No life till leather
We are gonna kick some ass tonight
We got the metal madness
When our fans start screaming
It's right well alright
When we start to rock
We never want to stop again
Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights
You know our fans are insane
We are gonna blow this place away
with volume higher
Than anything today the only way
When we start to rock
We never want to stop again
Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights
With all our screaming
We are gonna rip right through your brain
We got the lethal power
It is causing you sweet pain Oh sweet pain
When we start to rock
We never want to stop again
Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights


By the last breath of the fourth winds blow
Better raise your ears
The sound of hooves knock at your door
Lock up your wife and children now
It's time to wield the blade
For now you have got some company
The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On leather steeds they ride
They've come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the Four Horsemen ride
Or choose your fate and die
You have been dying since the day you were born
You know it has all been planned
The quartet of deliverance rides
A sinner once a sinner twice
No need for confessions now
Cause now you have got the fight of your life
The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On leather steeds they ride
They've come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the Four Horsemen ride
Or choose your fate and die
Time
Has taken its toll on you
The lines that crack your face
Famine
Your body it has torn through
Withered in every place
Pestilence
For what you have had to endure
And what you have put others through
Death
Deliverance for you for sure
Now there is nothing you can do
So gather round young warriors now
And saddle up your steeds
Killing scores with demon swords
Now is the death of doers of wrong
Swing the judgement hammer down
Safely inside armor blood guts and sweat
The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On leather steeds they ride
They've come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the Four Horsemen ride
Or choose your fate and die


Living and dying laughing and crying
Once you have seen it you will never be the same
Life in the fast lane is just how it seems
Hard and it's heavy, it's dirty and mean
Motorbreath
It's how I live my life
I can't take it any other way
Motorbreath
The sign of living fast
It is going to take
Your breath away
Don't stop for nothing it's full speed or nothing
I am taking down you know whatever is in my way
Getting your kicks as you are shooting the line
Sending the shivers up and down your spine
Motorbreath
It's how I live my life
I can't take it any other way
Motorbreath
The sign of living fast
It is going to take
Your breath away
Those people who tell you not to take chances
They are all missing on what life is about
You only live once so take hold of the chance
Don't end up like others the same song and dance
Motorbreath
It's how I live my life
I can't take it any other way
Motorbreath
The sign of living fast
It is going to take
Your breath away


Down in the depths of my fiery home
The summons bell will chime
Tempting you and all the earth
to join our sinful kind
There is a job to be done and I'm the one
You people make me do it
Now it is time for your fate and I won't hesitate
to pull you down into this pit
So come on
Jump in the Fire
So come on
Jump in the Fire
With hell in my eyes and with death in my veins
The end is closing in
Feeding on the minds of man
and from their souls within
My disciples all shout to search you out
And they always shall obey
Follow me now my child not the meek or the mild
But do just as I say
So come on
Jump in the Fire
So come on
Jump in the Fire
Jump by your will or be taken by force
I'll get you either way
Trying to keep the hellfire lit
I am stalking you as prey
Living your life as me I am you you see
There is part of me in everyone
So reach down grab my hand walk with me through the land
Come home where you belong
So come on
Jump in the Fire
So come on
Jump in the Fire


Late at night, all systems go
You’ve come to see the show
We do our best, you’re the rest
You make it real, you know
There is a feeling deep inside
That drives you fuckin’ mad
A feeling of a hammerhead
You need it oh so bad
Adrenaline starts to flow
You’re thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash
Bang your head against the stage
Like you never did before
Make it ring, make it bleed
Make it really sore
In a frenzied madness
With your leathers and your spikes
Heads are bobbing all around
It’s hot as hell tonight
Adrenaline starts to flow
You’re thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash
Here on stage the Marshall noise
Is piercing through your ears
It kicks your ass, kicks your face
Exploding feeling nears
Now’s the time to let it rip
To let it fuckin’ loose
We’re gathered here to maim and kill
‘Cause this is what we choose
Adrenaline starts to flow
You’re thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Here we go
Whiplash
The show is through, the metal’s gone
It’s time to hit the road
Another town, another gig
Again we will explode
Hotel rooms and motorways
Life out here is raw
But we’ll never stop
We’ll never quit
‘Cause we’re Metallica
Adrenaline starts to flow
You’re thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac


Sound is ripping through your ears
The deafening sound of metal nears
Your bodies waiting for his whips
The taste of leather on your lips
Hear the cry of War
Louder than before
With his sword in hand
to control the land
Crushing metal strikes
on this frightening night
Fall onto your knees
For the Phantom Lord
Victims falling under chains
You hear them crying dying pains
The fists of terrors breaking through
Now there's nothing you can do
Hear the cry of War
Louder than before
With his sword in hand
to control the land
Crushing metal strikes
on this frightening night
Fall onto your knees
For the Phantom Lord
The leather armies have prevailed
The Phantom Lord has never failed
Smoke is lifting from the ground
The rising volume metal sound
Hear the cry of War
Louder than before
With his sword in hand
to control the land
Crushing metal strikes
on this frightening night
Fall onto your knees
For the Phantom Lord
Fall to your knees
and bow to the PhantomLord


No mercy for what we are doing
No thought to even what we have done
We don't need to feel the sorrow
No remorse for the helpless one
War without end
No remorse No repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day Another death
Another sorrow Another breath
No remorse No repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day Another death
Another sorrow Another breath
Blood feeds the war machine
as it eats its way across the land
We don't need the feel the sorrow
No remorse is the one command
War without end
No remorse No repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day Another death
Another sorrow Another breath
No remorse No repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day Another death
Another sorrow Another breath
Only the strong survive
No one to save the weaker race
We are ready to kill all comers
Like a loaded gun right at your face
War without end
No remorse No repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day Another death
Another sorrow Another breath
No remorse No repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day Another death
Another sorrow Another breath
Attack
Bullets are flying
People are dying
with madness surrounding all hell's breaking loose
Soldiers are hounding
Bodies are mounting
cannons are shouting to take their abuse
With war machines going
Blood starts to flowing
No mercy given to anyone hear
The furious fighting
Swords are like lighting
It all becomes frightening to you
Know death is near
No remorse

My mother was a witch, she was burned alive.
Thankless little bitch, for the tears I cried.
Take her down now, don't want to see her face
All blistered and burnt, can't hide my disgrace.
Twenty-seven, everyone was nice.
Gotta see 'em make 'em pay the price.
See their bodies out on the ice.
Take my time.
Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man, yes I am.
As I watched my mother die, I lost my head.
Revenge now I sought, to break with my bread.
Taking no chances, you come with me.
I'll split you to the bone, help set you free.
Twenty-seven, everyone was nice.
Gotta see 'em make 'em pay the price.
See their bodies out on the ice.
Take my time.
Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man, yes I am.
On with the action now, I'll strip your pride.
I'll spread your blood around, I'll see you ride.
Your face is scarred with steel, wounds deep and neat.
Like a double dozen before ya, smells so sweet.
Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man.
I'll make my residence, I'll watch your fire.
You can come with me, sweet desire.
My face is long forgot, my face not my own.
Sweet and timely whore, take me home.
Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man.
My soul is longing for, await my heir.
Sent to avenge my mother, sweep myself.
My face is long forgot, my face not my own.
Sweet and timely whore, take me home.
Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man.
Am I evil? Yes I fucking am.
Am I evil? I am man, yeah.


Let us have peace, let us have life,
Let us escape the cruel night.
Let us have time, let the sun shine,
Let us beware the deadly sign.
The day is coming, Armageddon's near,
Inferno's coming, can we survive the blitzkrieg.
The blitzkrieg, the blitzkrieg.
Save us from fate, save us from hate,
Save ourselves before it's too late.
Come to our need, hear our plea,
Save ourselves before the earth bleeds.
The day is dawning, the time is near,
Aliens calling, can we survive the blitzkrieg.


Do unto others as they've done to you
But what the hell is this world coming to? 
Blow the universe into nothingness
Nuclear warfare shall lay us to rest
Fight fire with fire
Ending is near
Fight fire with fire
Bursting with fear
We all shall die
Time is like a fuse, short and burning fast
Armageddon's here, like said in the past
Fight fire with fire
Ending is near
Fight fire with fire
Bursting with fear
Soon to fill our lungs, the hot winds of death
The gods are laughing, so take your last breath
Fight fire with fire
Ending is near
Fight fire with fire
Bursting with fear
Fight fire with fire
Fight fire with fire
Fight fire with fire
Fight fire with fire
Fight fire with fire
Fight fire with fire
Fight fire with fire
Fight fire with fire
Fight


Guilty as charged
But damn it, it ain't right
There's someone else controlling me
Death in the air
Strapped in the electric chair
This can't be happening to me
Who made you God to say
"I'll take your life from you?"
Flash before my eyes
Now it's time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flame
Wait for the sign
To flick the switch of death
It's the beginning of the end
Sweat, chilling cold
As I watch death unfold
Consciousness my only friend
My fingers grip with fear
What am I doing here?
Flash before my eyes
Now it's time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flame
Someone help me
Oh please, God help me
They're trying to take it all away
I don't want to die
Time moving slow
The minutes seem like hours
The final curtain call I see
How true is this?
Just get it over with
If this is true, just let it be
Wakened by horrid scream
Freed from this frightening dream
Flash before my eyes
Now it's time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flame


Make his fight on the hill in the early day
Constant chill deep inside
Shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey
On they fight, for they're right, yes, but who's to say?
For a hill, men would kill, why? They do not know
Stiffened wounds test their pride
Men of five, still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know
For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tolls
Take a look to the sky just before you die
It's the last time he will
Blackened roar, massive roar, fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry
Stranger now, are his eyes, to this mystery
He hears the silence so loud
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be
Now they see what will be, blinded eyes to see
For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tolls


Life, it seems, will fade away
Drifting further every day
Getting lost within myself
Nothing matters, no one else
I have lost the will to live
Simply nothing more to give
There is nothing more for me
Need the end to set me free
Things not what they used to be
Missing one inside of me
Deathly lost, this can't be real
Cannot stand this hell I feel
Emptiness is filling me
To the point of agony
Growing darkness taking dawn
I was me, but now he's gone
No one but me can save myself, but it's too late
Now I can't think, think why I should even try
Yesterday seems as though it never existed
Death greets me warm, now I will just say goodbye


I don't know how to live through this hell
Woken up, I'm still locked in this shell
Frozen soul, frozen down to the core
Break the ice, I can't take anymore
Freezing
Can't move at all
Screaming
Can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out
I'm trapped under ice
Crystallized, as I lay here and rest
Eyes of glass stare directly at death
From deep sleep I have broken away
No one knows, no one hears what I say
Freezing
Can't move at all
Screaming
Can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out
I'm trapped under ice
Scream from my soul
Fate, mystified
Hell, forever more 
No release from my cryonic state
What is this? I've been stricken by fate
Wrapped up tight, cannot move, can't break free
Hand of doom has a tight grip on me
Freezing
Can't move at all
Screaming
Can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out
I'm trapped under ice


Feel no pain, but my life ain't easy
I know I'm my best friend
No one cares, but I'm so much stronger
I'll fight until the end
To escape from the true false world
Undamaged destiny
Can't get caught in the endless circle
Ring of stupidity
Out for my own, out to be free
One with my mind, they just can't see
No need to hear things that they say
Life's for my own, to live my own way
Rape my mind and destroy my feelings
Don't tell me what to do
I don't care now 'cause I'm on my side
And I can see through you
Feed my brain with your so-called standards
Who says that I ain't right?
Break away from your common fashion
See through your blurry sight
Out for my own, out to be free
One with my mind, they just can't see
No need to hear things that they say
Life's for my own, to live my own way
See them try to bring the hammer down
No damn chains can hold me to the ground
Life's for my own, to live my own way 
Life's for my own, to live my own way
Life's for my own, to live my own way
Life's for my own, to live my own way
Life's for my own, to live my own way
Life's for my own, to live my own way


Slaves
Hebrews born to serve, to the pharaoh
Heed
To his every word, live in fear
Faith
Of the unknown one, the deliverer
Wait
Something must be done, four hundred years
So let it be written
So let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
So let it be written
So let it be done
To kill the first born pharaoh son
I'm creeping death
Now
Let my people go, land of goshen
Go
I will be with thee, bush of fire
Blood
Running red and strong, down the Nile
Plague
Darkness three days long, hail to fire
So let it be written
So let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
So let it be written
So let it be done
To kill the first born pharaoh son
I'm creeping death
Die by my hand
I creep across the land
Killing first born man
Die by my hand
I creep across the land
Killing first born man
I
Rule the midnight air, the destroyer
Born
I shall soon be there, deadly mass
I
Creep the steps and floor, final darkness
Blood
Lamb's blood, painted door, I shall pass
So let it be written
So let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
So let it be written
So let it be done
To kill the first born pharaoh son
I'm creeping death


Lashing out the action, returning the reaction
Weak are ripped and torn away
Hypnotizing power, crushing all that cower
Battery is here to stay
Smashing through the boundaries
Lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression
Turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery
Cannot kill the family
Battery is found in me
Battery
Battery
Crushing all deceivers, mashing non-believers
Never-ending potency
Hungry violence-seeker, feeding off the weaker
Breeding on insanity
Smashing through the boundaries
Lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression
Turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery
Cannot kill the family
Battery is found in me
Battery
Battery
Circle of destruction, hammer comes crushing
Powerhouse of energy
Whipping up a fury, dominating flurry
We create the battery
Smashing through the boundaries
Lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression
Turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery
Cannot kill the family
Battery is found in me
Battery 
Battery
Battery
Battery


End of passion play, crumbling away
I’m your source of self-destruction
Veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear
Leading on your death’s construction
Taste me you will see
More is all you need
You’re dedicated to
How I’m killing you
Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your master
Master
Master of puppets I’m pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can’t see a thing
Just call my name, ‘cause I’ll hear you scream
Master
Master
Just call my name, ‘cause I’ll hear you scream
Master
Master
Needlework the way, never you betray
Life of death becoming clearer
Pain monopoly, ritual misery
Chop your breakfast on a mirror
Taste me you will see
More is all you need
You’re dedicated to
How I’m killing you
Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your master
Master
Master of puppets I’m pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can’t see a thing
Just call my name, ‘cause I’ll hear you scream
Master
Master
Just call my name, ‘cause I’ll hear you scream
Master
Master
Master, master
Where’s the dreams that I’ve been after?
Master, master
You promised only lies
Laughter, laughter
All I hear or see is laughter
Laughter, laughter
Laughing at my cries
Fix me
Hell is worth all that, natural habitat
Just a rhyme without a reason
Never-ending maze, drift on numbered days
Now your life is out of season
I will occupy
I will help you die
I will run through you
Now I rule you too
Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your master
Master
Master of puppets I’m pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can’t see a thing
Just call my name, ‘cause I’ll hear you scream
Master
Master
Just call my name, ‘cause I’ll hear you scream
Master

Messenger of fear in sight
Dark deception kills the light
Hybrid children watch the sea
Pray for father, roaming free
Fearless wretch
Insanity
He watches
Lurking beneath the sea
Great old one
Forbidden site
He searches
Hunter of the shadows is rising
Immortal
In madness you dwell
Crawling chaos, underground
Cult has summoned, twisted sound
Out from ruins once possessed
Fallen city, living death
Fearless wretch
Insanity
He watches
Lurking beneath the sea
Timeless sleep
Has been upset
He awakens
Hunter of the shadows is rising
Immortal
In madness you dwell
Not dead which eternal lie
Stranger eons death may die
Drain you of your sanity
Face the thing that should not be
Fearless wretch
Insanity
He watches
Lurking beneath the sea
Great old one
Forbidden site
He searches
Hunter of the shadows is rising
Immortal
In madness you dwell


Welcome to where time stands still
No one leaves and no one will
Moon is full, never seems to change
Just labeled mentally deranged
Dream the same thing every night
I see our freedom in my sight
No locked doors, No windows barred
No things to make my brain seem scarred
Sleep my friend and you will see
That dream is my reality
They keep me locked up in this cage
Can't they see it's why my brain says Rage
Sanitarium, leave me be
Sanitarium, just leave me alone
Build my fear of what's out there
Cannot breathe the open air
Whisper things into my brain
Assuring me that I'm insane
They think our heads are in their hands
But violent use brings violent plans
Keep him tied, it makes him well
He's getting better, can't you tell?
No more can they keep us in
Listen, damn it, we will win
They see it right, they see it well
But they think this saves us from our hell
Sanitarium, leave me be
Sanitarium, just leave me alone
Sanitarium, just leave me alone
Fear of living on
Natives getting restless now
Mutiny in the air
Got some death to do
Mirror stares back hard
Kill, it's such a friendly word
Seems the only way
For reaching out again


Bodies fill the fields I see, hungry heroes end
No one to play soldier now, no one to pretend
Running blind through killing fields, bred to kill them all
Victim of what said should be
A servant 'til I fall
Soldier boy, made of clay
Now an empty shell
Twenty-one, only son
But he served us well
Bred to kill, not to care
Do just as we say
Finished here
Greetings, Death
He’s yours to take away
Back to the front
You will do what I say, when I say
Back to the front
You will die when I say, you must die
Back to the front
You coward
You servant
You blind man
Barking of machinegun fire does nothing to me now
Sounding of the clock that ticks, get used to it somehow
More a man, more stripes you bare, glory-seeker trends
Bodies fill the fields I see
The slaughter never ends
Soldier boy, made of clay
Now an empty shell
Twenty-one, only son
But he served us well
Bred to kill, not to care
Do just as we say
Finished here
Greetings, Death
He’s yours to take away
Back to the front
You will do what I say, when I say
Back to the front
You will die when I say, you must die
Back to the front
You coward
You servant
You blind man
Why, am I dying?
Kill, have no fear
Lie, live off lying
Hell, hell is here
I was born for dying
Life planned out before my birth, nothing could I say
Had no chance to see myself, molded day by day
Looking back I realize, nothing have I done
Left to die with only friend
Alone I clench my gun
Soldier boy, made of clay
Now an empty shell
Twenty-one, only son
But he served us well
Bred to kill, not to care
Do just as we say
Finished here
Greetings, Death
He’s yours to take away
Back to the front
You will do what I say, when I say
Back to the front
You will die when I say, you must die
Back to the front
You coward
You servant
You blind man
Back to the front


Spineless from the start, sucked into the part
Circus comes to town, you play the lead clown
Please, please
Spreading his disease, living by his story
Knees, knees
Falling to your knees, suffer for his glory
You will
Time for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green
Heaven you will meet
Make a contribution
And you'll get a better seat
Bow to Leper Messiah
Marvel at his tricks, need your Sunday fix
Blind devotion came, rotting your brain
Chain, chain
Join the endless chain
Taken by his glamour
Fame, Fame
Infection is the game, stinking drunk with power
We see
Time for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green
Heaven you will meet
Make a contribution
And you'll get a better seat
Bow to Leper Messiah
Witchery, weakening
Sees the sheep are gathering
Set the trap, hypnotize
Now you follow
Time for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green
Heaven you will meet
Make a contribution
And you'll get a better seat
Lie
Lie
Lie
Lie
Lie
Lie
Lie
Lie


Dealing out the agony within
Charging hard and no one's gonna give in
Living on your knees, conformity
Or dying on your feet for honesty
Inbred, our bodies work as one
Bloody, but never cry submission
Following our instinct not a trend
Go against the grain until the end
Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here
Damage Incorporated
Slamming through, don't fuck with razorback
Stepping out? You'll feel our hell on your back
Blood follows blood and we make sure
Life ain't for you and we're the cure
Honesty is my only excuse
Try to rob us of it, but it's no use
Steamroller action crushing all
Victim is your name and you shall fall
Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here
Damage Incorporated
We chew and spit you out
We laugh, you scream and shout
All flee, with fear you run
You'll know just where we come from
Damage Incorporated
Damage jackals ripping right through you
Sight and smell of this, it gets me goin'
Know just how to get just what we want
Tear it from your soul in nightly hunt
Fuck it all and fucking no regrets
Never happy ending on these dark sets
All's fair for Damage Inc. you see
Step a little closer if you please
Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here
Damage Incorporated


I've gotta see you moving fast, see you come my way.
See the dreams, I hope they last, never fade away.
Gotta see the lights above, make it loud tonight.
Gotta set it all afire, set it all alight.
See the flashing lights, hear the thunder roar,
I am gonna set you all alight.
Gotta make it man, I ain't got a choice,
Gotta fill this hall tonight.
Helpless, helpless, helpless, helpless.
I don't know what I'm gonna do, maybe not tonight.
Gotta set you all afire, gotta treat you right.
I can see the flashing lights, lit before your love.
Gotta hear the thunder roar, coming from above.
See the flashing lights, hear the thunder roar,
I am gonna set you all alight.
Gotta make it man, I ain't got a choice,
Gotta fill this hall tonight.
Helpless, helpless, helpless, helpless.
I can see the stars, I can see what's going on.
Every night alone I sing my song just for fun.
Only time will tell if I'll make it myself someday.
This stage is mine, music is my destiny.
Cannot squeeze the life from me.
I can see the stars, I can see what's going on.
Every night alone I sing my song just for fun.
Only time will tell if I'll make it myself someday.
This stage is mine, music is my destiny.
Cannot squeeze the life from me.


Look out at the darkness, and you will see.
Just call my name and I'll be there.
You cannot touch me, you would not dare.
I am the chill that's in the air.
And I try to get through to you, in my own special way,
As the barriers crumble at the end of the day.
Dark rivers are flowing back into the past.
You are the fish for which I cast.
And what of the future, what is to be.
As the rivers flow into the sea.
And I try to get through to you, in my own special way,
As the barriers crumble at the end of the day.
Do not take for granted, powers out there.
Don't step into the demon's lair.
Time is an illusion, rising from time.
Steep is the mountain which we climb.
And I try to get through to you, in my own special way,
As the barriers crumble at the end of the day.


Motives changing, day to day,
The fire increases, masks decay.
I look at the river, white foam floats down,
The body's poisoned, gotta sit tight.
The wait, the wait, the wait, the wait.
After wakening, silence grows,
The screams subside, distortion shows.
Mutant thoughts of bad mouthed news,
Is just another birth of distorted views.
The wait, the wait, the wait, the wait.
The wait, the wait, the wait, the wait.


Look inside and you will see,
The words are cutting deep inside my brain.
Thunder burning, quickly burning,
Knife of words is driving me insane, insane yeah.
Raven black is on my track,
He shows me how to neutralize the knife.
Show to me in surgery,
The art of fighting words to conquer life, conquer life yeah.
Now the wicked lance of fear,
Is driving from my heady mountain brain.
Crash course in brain surgery,
Has stopped the bloody knife of words again yeah, yeah, yeah.

I bet you never knew you would.
Gonna bring green hell, green hell.


Blackened is the end
Winter it will send
Throwing all you see
Into obscurity
Death of Mother Earth
Never a rebirth
Evolution’s end
Never will it mend
Never
Fire
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Blackened is the end
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Color our world blackened
Blistering of earth
Terminate its worth
Deadly nicotine
Kills what might have been
Callous frigid chill
Nothing left to kill
Never seen before
Breathing nevermore
Never
Fire
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Blackened is the end
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Color our world blackened
Blackened
Opposition...contradiction...premonition...compromise
Agitation...violation...mutilation...planet dies
Darkest color
Blistered earth
True death of life
Termination...expiration...cancellation...human race
Expectation...liberation...population...lay to waste
See our mother
Put to death
See our mother die
Smoldering decay
Take her breath away
Millions of our years
In minutes disappears
Darkening in vain
Decadence remains
All is said and done
Never is the sun
Never
Fire
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Blackened is the end
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Fire
Is the outcome of hypocrisy
Darkest potency
In the exit of humanity
Color our world blackened
Blackened


Halls of justice painted green
Money talking
Power wolves beset your door
Hear them stalking
Soon you’ll please their appetite
They devour
Hammer of justice crushes you
Overpower
The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can’t believe the things you say
I can’t believe
I can’t believe the price you pay
Nothing can save you
Justice is lost
Justice is raped
Justice is gone
Pulling your strings
Justice is done
Seeking no truth
Winning is all
Find it so grim
So true
So real
Apathy their stepping stone
So unfeeling
Hidden deep animosity
So deceiving
Through your eyes their light burns
Hoping to find
Inquisition sinking you
With prying minds
The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can’t believe the things you say
I can’t believe
I can’t believe the price you pay
Nothing can save you
Justice is lost
Justice is raped
Justice is gone
Pulling your strings
Justice is done
Seeking no truth
Winning is all
Find it so grim
So true
So real
Lady Justice has been raped
Truth assassin
Rolls of red tape seal your lips
Now you’re done in
Their money tips her scales again
Make your deal
Just what is truth? I cannot tell
Cannot feel
The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can’t believe the things you say
I can’t believe
I can’t believe the price you pay
Nothing can save you
Justice is lost
Justice is raped
Justice is gone
Pulling your strings
Justice is done
Seeking no truth
Winning is all
Find it so grim
So true
So real
Seeking no truth
Winning is all
Find it so grim
So true
So real


Do you see what I see?
Truth is an offence
Your silence for your confidence
Do you hear what I hear?
Doors are slamming shut
Limit your imagination, keep you where they must
Do you feel what I feel?
Bittering distress
Who decides what you express?
Do you take what I take?
Endurance is the word
Moving back instead of forward seems to me absurd
Doesn’t matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it’s done just how I say
Independence limited
Freedom of choice
Choice is made for you, my friend
Freedom of speech
Speech is words that they will bend
Freedom with their exception
Do you fear what I fear?
Living properly
Truths to you are lies to me
Do you choose what I choose?
More alternatives
Energy derives from both the plus and negative
Do you need what I need?
Boundaries overthrown
Look inside, to each his own
Do you trust what I trust?
Me, myself and I
Penetrate the smoke screen, I see through the selfish lie
Doesn’t matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it’s done just how I say
Independence limited
Freedom of choice
Choice is made for you, my friend
Freedom of speech
Speech is words that they will bend
Freedom with their exception
Do you know what I know?
Your money and your wealth
Your silence just to hear yourself
Do you want what I want?
Desire not a thing
I hunger after independence, lengthen freedom’s ring
Doesn’t matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it’s done just how I say
Independence limited
Freedom of choice
Choice is made for you, my friend
Freedom of speech
Speech is words that they will bend
Freedom no longer frees you
Doesn’t matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it’s done just how I say


I can’t remember anything
Can’t tell if this is true or dream
Deep down inside I feel to scream
This terrible silence stops me
Now that the war is through with me
I’m waking up, I cannot see
That there’s not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please, God, wake me
Back in the womb it’s much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can’t look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I’ll live
Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from me
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please, God, wake me
Now the world is gone, I’m just one
Oh God, help me Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please, God, help me
Darkness
Imprisoning me
All that I see
Absolute horror
I cannot live
I cannot die
Trapped in myself
Body my holding cell
Landmine
Has taken my sight
Taken my speech
Taken my hearing
Taken my arms
Taken my legs
Taken my soul
Left me with life in hell


Suspicion is your name
Your honesty to blame
Put dignity to shame
Dishonor
Witchhunt, modern day
Determining decay
The blatant disarray
Disfigure
The public eye’s disgrace
Defying common place
Unending paper chase
Unending
Deafening
Painstaking
Reckoning
This vertigo it doth bring
Shortest straw
Challenge liberty
Downed by law
Live in infamy
Rub you raw
Witchhunt riding through
Shortest straw
The shortest straw has been pulled for you
Pulled for you
Shortest straw
Pulled for you
Shortest straw
Pulled for you
Shortest straw
The shortest straw has been pulled for you
The accusations fly
Discrimination, why?
Your inner self to die
Intruding
Doubt sunk itself in you
Its teeth and talons through
You’re living Catch-22
Deluding
A mass hysteria
A megalomania
Reveal dementia
Reveal
Secretly
Silently
Certainly
In vertigo you will be
Shortest straw
Challenge liberty
Downed by law
Live in infamy
Rub you raw
Witchhunt riding through
Shortest straw
This shortest straw has been pulled for you
Pulled for you
Shortest straw
Pulled for you
Shortest straw
Pulled for you
Shortest straw
Shortest straw has been pulled for you
Shortest straw
Pulled for you
Shortest straw
Pulled for you
Shortest straw
Pulled for you
Shortest straw
Shortest straw has been pulled for you
Behind you, hands are tied
Your being, ostracized
Your hell is multiplied
Upending
The fallout has begun
Oppressive damage done
Your many turned to none
To nothing
You’re reaching your nadir
Your will has disappeared
The lie is crystal clear
Defending
Channels red
One word said
Blacklisted
With vertigo make you dead
Shortest straw
Challenge liberty
Downed by law
Live in infamy
Rub you raw
Witchhunt riding through
Shortest straw
The shortest straw has been pulled for you
Pulled for you


My life suffocates
Planting seeds of hate
I’ve loved, turned to hate
Trapped far beyond my fate
I give, you take
This life that I forsake
Been cheated of my youth
You turned this lie to truth
Anger
Misery
You’ll suffer unto me
Harvester of sorrow
Language of the mad
Harvester of sorrow
Pure black, looking clear
My work is done soon here
Try getting back to me
Get back which used to be
Drink up
Shoot in
Let the beatings begin
Distributor of pain
Your loss becomes my gain
Anger
Misery
You’ll suffer unto me
Harvester of sorrow
Language of the mad
Harvester of sorrow
All have said their prayers
Invade their nightmares
To see into my eyes
You’ll find where murder lies
Infanticide
Harvester of sorrow
Language of the mad
Harvester of sorrow
Language of the mad
Harvester of sorrow


Never hunger
Never prosper
I have fallen prey to failure
Struggle within
Triggered again
Now the candle burns at both ends
Twisting under schizophrenia
Falling deep into dementia
Old habits reappear
Fighting the fear of fear
Growing conspiracy
Everyone’s after me
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling
Hear them calling me
Birth of terror
Death of much more
I’m the slave of fear, my captor
Never warnings
Spreading its wings
As I wait for the horror she brings
Loss of interest, question, wonder
Waves of fear they pull me under
Old habits reappear
Fighting the fear of fear
Growing conspiracy
Everyone’s after me
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling
Hear them calling me
Into ruin
I am sinking
Hostage of this nameless feeling
Hell is set free
Flooded I’ll be
Feel the undertow inside me
Height, hell, time, haste, terror, tension
Life, death, want, waste, mass depression
Old habits reappear
Fighting the fear of fear
Growing conspiracy
Myself is after me
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling
Hear them calling me


When a man lies he murders some part of the world
These are the pale deaths which men miscall their lives
All this I cannot bear to witness any longer
Cannot the kingdom of salvation take me home


Dear Mother
Dear Father
What is this hell you have put me through
Believer
Deceiver
Day in, day out, live my life through you
Pushed onto me what’s wrong or right
Hidden from this thing that they call life
Dear Mother
Dear Father
Every thought I’d think you’d disapprove
Curator
Dictator
Always censoring my every move
Children are seen but are not heard
Tear out everything inspired
Innocence
Torn from me without your shelter
Barred reality
I’m living blindly
Dear Mother
Dear Father
Time has frozen still what’s left to be
Hear nothing
Say nothing
Cannot face the fact I think for me
No guarantee, it’s life as is
But damn you for not giving me my chance
Dear Mother
Dear Father
You’ve clipped my wings before I learned to fly
Unspoiled
Unspoken
I’ve outgrown that fucking lullaby
Same thing I’ve always heard from you
Do as I say, not as I do
Innocence
Torn from me without your shelter
Barred reality
I’m living blindly
I’m in hell without you
Cannot cope without you two
Shocked at the world that I see
Innocent victim please rescue me
Dear Mother
Dear Father
Hidden in your world you’ve made for me
I’m seething
I’m bleeding
Ripping wounds in me that never heal
Undying spite I feel for you
Living out this hell you always knew


Say your prayers, little one
Don't forget, my son
To include everyone
Tuck you in, warm within
Keep you free from sin
Till the Sandman he comes
Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight
Exit: light
Enter: night
Take my hand
We're off to never never land
Something's wrong, shut the light
Heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of Snow White
Dreams of war, dreams of liars
Dreams of dragon's fire
And of things that will bite
Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight
Exit: light
Enter: night
Take my hand
We're off to never never land
Now I lay me down to sleep
Pray the Lord my soul to keep
If I die before I wake
Pray the Lord my soul to take
Hush little baby, don't say a word
And never mind that noise you heard
It's just the beasts under your bed
In your closet, in your head
Exit: light
Enter: night
Grain of sand
Exit: light
Enter: night
Take my hand
We're off to never never land

No more!
The crap rolls out your mouth again
Haven't changed, your brain is still gelatin
Little whispers circle around your head
Why don't you worry about yourself instead
Who are you? Where ya been? Where ya from?
Gossip is burning on the tip of your tongue
You lie so much you believe yourself
Judge not lest ye be judged yourself
Holier than thou
You are
Holier than thou
You are
You know not
Before you judge me take a look at you
Can't you find something better to do
Point the finger, slow to understand
Arrogance and ignorance go hand in hand
It's not who you are it's who you know
Others lives are the basis of your own
Burn your bridges build them back with wealth
Judge not lest ye be judged yourself
Holier than thou
You are
Holier than thou
You are
You know not
Yeah
Who the hell are you?
Hey you
Holier than thou
You are
Holier than thou
You are
You know not
Know not


New blood joins this earth,
And quickly he's subdued.
Through constant pained disgrace
The young boy learns their rules.
With time the child draws in.
This whipping boy done wrong.
Deprived of all his thoughts
The young man struggles on and on he's known
A vow unto his own,
That never from this day
His will they'll take away.
What I've felt,
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown.
Never be.
Never see.
Won't see what might have been.
What I've felt,
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown.
Never free.
Never me.
So I dub thee unforgiven.
They dedicate their lives
To running all of his.
He tries to please them all –
This bitter man he is.
Throughout his life the same –
He's battled constantly.
This fight he cannot win –
A tired man they see no longer cares.
The old man then prepares
To die regretfully –
That old man here is me.
What I've felt,
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown.
Never be.
Never see.
Won't see what might have been.
What I've felt,
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown.
Never free.
Never me.
So I dub thee unforgiven.[Solo]
What I've felt,

Never shined through in what I've shown.

...and the road becomes my bride
I have stripped of all but pride
So in her I do confide
And she keeps me satisfied
Gives me all I need
...and with dust in throat I crave
Only knowledge will I save
To the game you stay a slave
Rover, wanderer
Nomad, vagabond
Call me what you will
But I'll take my time anywhere
Free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll redefine anywhere
Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home
...and the earth becomes my throne
I adapt to the unknown
Under wandering stars I've grown
By myself but not alone
I ask no one
...and my ties are severed clean
The less I have the more I gain
Off the beaten path I reign
Rover, wanderer
Nomad, vagabond
Call me what you will
But I'll take my time anywhere
I'm free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll never mind anywhere
Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home
But I'll take my time anywhere
I'm free to speak my mind
And I'll take my find anywhere
Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home[Solo]
But I'll take my time anywhere
I'm free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll redefine anywhere
Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home
Carved upon my stone
My body lie but still I roam
Wherever I may roam
Wherever I may roam
Wherever I may roam
Wherever I may roam
Wherever I may wander, wander, wander
Wherever I may roam


Liberty or death, what we so proudly hail
Once you provoke her, rattling of her tail
Never begins it, never, but once engaged...
Never surrenders, showing the fangs of rage
Don't tread on me
So be it
Threaten no more
To secure peace is to prepare for war
So be it
Settle the score
Touch me again for the words that you'll hear evermore...
Don't tread on me
Love it or leave it, she with the deadly bite
Quick is the blue tongue, forked as the lightning strike
Shining with brightness, always on surveillance
The eyes, they never close, emblem of vigilance
Don't tread on me
So be it
Threaten no more
To secure peace is to prepare for war
So be it
Settle the score
Touch me again for the words that you'll hear evermore...
Don't tread on me
So be it
Threaten no more
To secure peace is to prepare for war
Liberty or death, what we so proudly hail
Once you provoke her, rattling of her tail
So be it
Threaten no more
To secure peace is to prepare for war
So be it
Settle the score
Touch me again for the words that you'll hear evermore...
Don't tread on me


All that is, was and will be
Universe much too big to see
Time and space never ending
Disturbing thoughts, questions pending
Limitations of human understanding
Too quick to criticize
Obligation to survive
We hunger to be alive
Twisting 
Turning 
Through the never
All that is, ever
Ever was
Will be ever
Twisting
Turning
Through the never
In the dark, see past our eyes
Pursuit of truth no matter where it lies
Gazing up to the breeze of the heavens
On a quest, meaning, reason
Came to be, how it begun
All alone in the family of the sun
Curiosity teasing everyone
On our home, third stone from the sun
Twisting 
Turning 
Through the never
All that is, ever
Ever was
Will be ever
Twisting
Turning
Through the never
On through the never
We must go
On through the never
Out to the
Edge of forever
We must go
On through the never
Then never comes
Twisting 
Turning 
Through the never
All that is, ever
Ever was
Will be ever
Twisting
Turning
Who we are
Ask forever
Twisting
Turning
Through the never
Never


So close no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters
Never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say
And nothing else matters
Trust I seek and I find in you
Every day for us something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know
So close no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know
I never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say
And nothing else matters
Trust I seek and I find in you
Every day for us something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters
Never cared for what they say
Never cared for games they play
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
And I know
So close no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
No nothing else matters


Off through the new day's mist I run
Out from the new day's mist I have come
I hunt
Therefore I am
Harvest the land
Taking of the fallen lamb
Off through the new day's mist I run
Out from the new day's mist I have come
We shift
Pulsing with the earth
Company we keep
Roaming the land while you sleep
Shape shift, nose to the wind
Shape shift, feeling I've been
Move swift, all senses clean
Earth's gift, back to the meaning
Back to the meaning of life
Bright is the moon, high in starlight
Chill in the air cold as steel tonight
We shift
Call of the wild
Fear in your eyes
It's later than you realized
Shape shift, nose to the wind
Shape shift, feeling I've been
Move swift, all senses clean
Earth's gift, back to the meaning
Back to the meaning of life
I feel a change
Back to a better day
Shape shift, hair stands on the back of my neck
Shape shift, in wildness is the preservation of the world 
So seek the wolf in thyself
Shape shift, nose to the wind
Shape shift, feeling I have been
Move swift, all senses clean
Earth's gift, back to the meaning
Back to the meaning of wolf and man


Pride you took
Pride you feel
Pride that you felt when you'd kneel
Not the word
Not the love
Not what you thought from above
It feeds
It grows
It clouds all that you will know
Deceit
Deceive
Decide just what you believe
I see faith in your eyes
Never you hear the discouraging lies
I hear faith in your cries
Broken is the promise, betrayal
The healing hand held back by the deepened nail
Follow the god that failed
Find your peace
Find your say
Find the smooth road on your way
Trust you gave
A child to save
Left you cold and him in grave
It feeds
It grows
It clouds all that you will know
Deceit
Deceive
Decide just what you believe
I see faith in your eyes
Never you hear the discouraging lies
I hear faith in your cries
Broken is the promise, betrayal
The healing hand held back by the deepened nail
Follow the god that failed
I see faith in your eyes
Broken is the promise, betrayal
The healing hand held back by the deepened nail
Follow the god that failed
Pride you took
Pride you feel
Pride that you felt when you'd kneel
Trust you gave
A child to save
Left you cold and him in grave
I see faith in your eyes
Never you hear the discouraging lies
I hear faith in your cries
Broken is the promise, betrayal
The healing hand held back by deepened nail
Follow the god that failed
Follow the god that failed 
Broken is the promise 
Betrayal 
Betrayal
Yeah


You just stood there screaming
Fearing no one was listening to you
They say the empty can rattles the most
The sound of your own voice must soothe you
Hearing only what you want to hear
And knowing only what you've heard
You, you're smothered in tragedy
And you're out to save the world
Misery
You insist that the weight of the world
Should be on your shoulders
Misery
There's much more to life than what you see
My friend of misery
You still stood there screaming
No one caring about these words you tell
My friend, before your voice is gone
One man's fun is another's hell
These times are sent to try men's souls
But something's wrong with all you see
You, you'll take it on all yourself
Remember, misery loves company
Misery
You insist that the weight of the world
Should be on your shoulders
Misery
There's much more to life than what you see
My friend of misery, my friend of misery
Misery
You insist that the weight of the world
Should be on your shoulders
Misery
There's much more to life than what you see
My friend of misery
You just stood there screaming
My friend of misery


Reaching out for something you've got to feel
While clutching to what you had thought was real
Kicking at a dead horse pleases you
No way of showing your gratitude
So many things you don't want to do
What is it? What have you got to lose?
What the hell?
What is it you think you're going to find?
Hypocrite
Boredom sets into the boring mind
Struggle within, it suits you fine
Struggle within, your ruin
Struggle within, you seal your own coffin
Struggle within, the struggling within
Home is not a home, it becomes a hell
Turning it into your prison cell
Advantages are taken, not handed out
While you struggle inside your hell
Reaching out
Grabbing for something you've got to feel
Closing in
The pressure upon you is so unreal
Struggle within, it suits you fine
Struggle within, your ruin
Struggle within, you seal your own coffin
Struggle within, the struggling within 
Struggle
Reaching out for something you've got to feel
While clutching to what you had thought was real
What the hell?
What is it you think you're going to find?
Hypocrite
Boredom sets into the boring mind
Struggle within, it suits you fine
Struggle within, your ruin
Struggle within, you seal your own coffin
Struggle within, the struggling within


Outta my way
Outta my day
Out of your mind and into mine
Into no one
Into not one
Into your step but out of time
Headstrong
What’s wrong?
I’ve already heard this song before
You arrived, but now it’s time to kiss your ass goodbye
Dragging me down
Why you around?
So useless
It ain’t my fall
It ain’t my call
It ain’t my bitch
It ain’t my bitch
Down on the sun
Down and no fun
Down and out, where the hell you been?
Damn it all down
Damn it unbound
Damn it all down to hell again
Stand tall
Can’t fall
Never even bend at all before
You arrived, but now it’s time to kiss your ass goodbye
Dragging me down
Why you around?
So useless
It ain’t my fall
It ain’t my call
It ain’t my bitch
Outta my way
Outta my way
Outta my day
Out of your mind and into mine
Into no one
Into not one
Into your step but out of time
Headstrong
What’s wrong?
I’ve already heard this song before
You arrived, but now it’s time to kiss your ass goodbye
And now it’s time to kiss your ass goodbye
Dragging me down
While you around?
So useless
It ain’t my fall
It ain’t my call
It ain’t my bitch
No way but down
Why you’re around
No fooling
It ain’t my smile
It ain’t my style
It ain’t my bitch
Oh, it ain’t mine
Ain’t mine
Your kind
You’re stepping out of time
Ain’t mine
Your kind
You’re stepping out of time
Taking me down
Why you around
No fooling
It ain’t my fall
It ain’t my call
It ain’t my bitch
You ain’t mine


I’m gonna make you, shake you, take you
I’m gonna be the one who breaks you
Put the screws to you, yeah, my way
Yeah, come on and come on, come and make my day
Make my day
Got some hell to pay, I steal your thunder
The joy of violent movement, pulls you under
Bite the bullet, well hard
Yeah, but I die harder, so go too far
Too far
Friction, fusion, retribution
I can’t hear you, talk to me
I can’t hear you, so talk to me
I can’t hear you, are you talking to me?
I can’t hear you, are you talking to me?
I can’t hear you, time to meet my lord
I can’t hear you, talk to two by four

I’m gonna be that one who breaks you
Put the screws to you, my way
Hey, come on and come on, come and make my day
Make my day
Friction, fusion, retribution

Open door, so I walk inside
Close my eyes, find my place to hide
And I shake as I take it in
Let the show begin
Open my eyes just to have them close again
Well on my way, but on my way to where I’ve been
It swallows me as it takes me in its fog
I twist away as I give this world the nod
Open door, so I walk inside
Close my eyes, find my place to hide
And I shake as I take it in
Let the show begin
Open my eyes just to have them closed once again
Don’t want control
As it takes me down and down and down again
Is that the moon or just a light that lights this dead-end street?
Is that you there or just another demon that I meet?
The higher you are
The farther you fall
The longer the walk
The farther you crawl
My body, my temple
This temple, it tilts
Step into the house that Jack built
The higher you are
The farther you fall
The longer the walk
The farther you crawl
My body, my temple
This temple, it tilts
Yes, this is the house that Jack built
Open door, yes, I walk inside
Swallow me so the pain subsides
And I shake as I take the sin
Let the show begin
The higher you are
The farther you fall
The longer the walk
The farther you crawl
My body, my temple
This temple, it tilts
Yes, this is the house that Jack built
The higher you are
The farther you fall
The longer the walk
The farther you crawl
My body, my temple
This temple, it tilts
Yes, I am, I am, I am
Open my eyes
It swallows me
Is that you there
I twist away
Away
Away
Away


Where do I take this pain of mine?
I run, but it stays right by my side
So tear me open, pour me out
There’s things inside that scream and shout
And the pain still hates me
So hold me until it sleeps
Just like the curse, just like the stray
You feed it once and now it stays
Now it stays
So tear me open but beware
There’s things inside without a care
And the dirt still stains me
So wash me until I’m clean
It grips you, so hold me
It stains you, so hold me
It hates you, so hold me
It holds you, so hold me
Until it sleeps
So tell me why you’ve chosen me
Don’t want your grip
Don’t want your greed
Don’t want it
I’ll tear me open, make you gone
No more can you hurt anyone
And the fear still shakes me
So hold me until it sleeps
It grips you, so hold me
It stains you, so hold me
It hates you, so hold me
It holds you, holds you, holds you
Until it sleeps
I don’t want it
So tear me open but beware
There’s things inside without a care
And the dirt still stains me
So wash me... till clean
I’ll tear me open, make you gone
No longer will you hurt anyone
And the hate still shapes me
So hold me until it sleeps
Until it sleeps


Wish I may, wish I might
Have this I wish tonight
Are you satisfied?
Dig for gold, dig for fame
You dig to make your name
Are you pacified?
All the wants you waste
All the things you’ve chased
Then it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger
But there’s no one around
Just want one thing
Just to play the king
But the castle’s crumbled
And you’re left with just a name
Where’s your crown,
King Nothing?
Where’s your crown?
Hot and cold, bought and sold
A heart as hard as gold
Are you satisfied?
Wish I might, wish I may
You wish your life away
Are you pacified?
All the wants you waste
All the things you’ve chased
Then it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger
But there’s no one around
Just want one thing
Just to play the king
But the castle’s crumbled
And you’re left with just a name
Where’s your crown, King Nothing?
Where’s your crown?
I wish I may, I wish I might
Have this wish I wish tonight
I want that star, I want it now
I want it all and I don’t care how
Careful what you wish
Careful what you say
Careful what you wish, you may regret it
Careful what you wish, you just might get it
Then it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger
But there’s no one around
Just want one thing
Just to play the king
But the castle’s crumbled
And you’re left with just a name
Where’s your crown, King Nothing?
Nothing
You’re just nothing
Where’s your crown, King Nothing?
You’re just nothing
Absolutely nothing
Off to never-never land


Mama, they try and break me
The window burns to light the way back home
A light that warms no matter where they’ve gone
They’re off to find the hero of the day
But what if they should fall by someone’s wicked way?
Still the window burns
Time so slowly turns
And someone there is sighing
Keepers of the flames
Do you feel your name?
Did you hear your babies crying?
Mama, they try and break me
Still they try and break me
Excuse me while I tend to how I feel
These things return to me that still seem real
Now, deservingly, this easy chair
But the rocking stopped by wheels of despair
Don’t want your aid
But the fist I make
For years can’t hold or feel
No, I’m not all me
So please excuse me while I tend to how I feel
But now the dreams and waking screams
That ever last the night
So build the wall, behind it crawl
And hide until it’s light
So can you hear your babies crying now?
Still the window burns
Time so slowly turns
And someone there is sighing
Keepers of the flames
Did you feel your names?
Did you hear your babies crying?
But now the dreams and waking screams
That ever last the night
So build a wall, behind it crawl
And hide until it’s light
So can’t you hear your babies crying now?
Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try and break me
Mama they try
Mama they try

The man takes another bullet
He keeps them all within
He must seek no matter how it hurts
So don’t fool again
He thinks the answer’s cold and in his hand
He takes his medicine
The man takes another bullet
He’s been fooled again
Uncross your arms
Take and throw them to the cure, say,
“I do believe”
Uncross your arms now
Take them to it, say
“I do believe”
“I do believe”
The lies tempt her and she follows
Again she lets him in
She must believe to fill the hollow
She’s been fooled again
Uncross your arms
Take and throw them to the cure, say
“I do believe”
Uncross your arms now
Take them to it, say,
“I do believe”
“Yeah, I do believe”
Betting on the cure
It must get better than this
Betting on the cure
Everyone’s got to have the sickness
‘Cause everyone seems to need the cure
Precious cure
Betting on the cure
‘Cause it must get better than this
Betting on the cure
Everyone’s got to have the sickness
‘Cause everyone seems to need the cure
Precious cure
“I do believe”
Betting on the cure
It must get better than this
Need to feel secure
It’s got to get better than this
It must get better than this
Betting on the cure
Everyone’s got to have the sickness
‘Cause everyone seems to need the cure
“I do believe”


Oh, poor twisted me
Oh, poor twisted me
I feast on sympathy
I chew on suffer
I chew on agony
Swallow whole the pain
Oh, it’s too good to be
That all this misery
Is just for, oh, poor twisted me
Poor twisted me
Poor mistreated me
Poor mistreated me
I drown without a sea
Lungs fill with sorrow
Lungs fill with misery
Inhaling the deep, dark blue
Oh, woe is me
Such a burden to be
The poor mistreated me
To finally reach the shore, survive the storm
Now you’re bare and cold, the sea was warm
So warm, you bathe your soul again
Baby, again and again and again
You finally reached the shore, survived the storm
Now you’re bare and cold, the sea was warm
So warm, you bathe your soul again
Good to feel my friend
Oh, woe is me
Such a burden to be
Oh, poor twisted me
Yo, poor twisted me


Good day. How do?
And I send a smile to you
Don’t waste, waste your breath
And I won’t waste my hate on you
Ain’t gonna waste my hate
Ain’t gonna waste my hate on you
I think I’ll keep it for myself
Ain’t gonna give no more
Ain’t got the time to help you score
I think it’s time you pleased yourself
Yourself
Good day. How do?
And I send a smile to you
Don’t waste, waste your breath
And I won’t waste my hate on you
Waste my hate on you
Hate
You think you’re worthy now?
You think enough to even raise the brow
And to laugh and tip that two-pronged crown?
Well I see my hands, I see my feet
I feel that blood that pumps in beat
But where the hell’s my mind going now?
Dead gone now
Good day. How do?
And I send a smile to you
Don’t waste, waste your breath
And I won’t waste my hate on you
Waste my hate on you
Think I’ll keep it for myself


Mama, she has taught me well
Told me when I was young
Son, your life’s an open book
Don’t close it ’fore it’s done
The brightest flame burns quickest
That’s what I heard her say
A son’s heart’s owed to mother
But I must find my way
Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or, let this heart be still
“Rebel,” my new last name
Wild blood in my veins
Apron strings around my neck
The mark that still remains
I left home at an early age
Of what I heard was wrong
I never asked forgiveness
But what is said is done
Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or let this heart be still
Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
So let this heart be still
Mama, now I’m coming home
I’m not all you wished of me
A mother’s love for her son
Unspoken, help me be
I took your love for granted
And all the things you said to me
I need your arms to welcome me
But a cold stone’s all I see
Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or let this heart be still
Let my heart go
Mama, let my heart go
You never let my heart go
So let this heart be still
Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
So let this heart be still


Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned
Find me guilty of the life I feel within
When I’m branded, this mark of shame
Should I look down, disgraced, or straight ahead and know that you must blame?
I am the secret
I am the sin
I am the guilty
And I am, I am the thorn within
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned
Find me guilty when true guilt is from within
So point your fingers, point right at me
For I am shadows and will follow you, one and the same are we
I am the secret
I am the sin
I am the guilty
And I am, I am the thorn within
I do your time, I take your fall
I’m branded guilty for us all
So point your fingers, point right at me
For I am shadows and will follow you, one and the same are we
I am your secrets
I am your sin
I am your guilty
And I am, I am the thorn within
I am the thorn within
I am the thorn within


Story starts, quiet town
Small-town boy, big-time frown
Never talks, never plays
Different path, lost his way
Then streets of red... red, I’m afraid...
There’s no confetti, no parade
Nothing happens in this boring place
But, oh my God, how it all did change
Now they all pray,
“Blood stain, wash away”
He said,
“Lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way”
I heard it
He said,
“Lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way”
Oh, please wash away
But blood stained the sun red today
I always said something’s wrong
With little, strange Ronnie Long
Never laughed, never smiled
Talked alone for miles and miles and miles
“Gallows calls, son,” I say
Keep your smile and laugh all day
Think once again in this boring place
For little boys, how they soon change
And they all pray,
“Blood stain, wash away”
He said,
“I lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way”
I heard it
He said,
“I lost my way
This bloody day
I lost my way”
Oh, please wash away
But blood stained the sun red today
Well, all the green things died when Ronnie moved to this place
He said, “Don’t you dare ask why I’m cursed to wear this face”
Now we all know why the children called him Ronnie Frown
When he pulled that gun from his pocket they all fall down, down, down
He said,
“Lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way”
Yeah, yeah
I heard it
He screamed,
“Lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way”
Oh, please wash away
But blood stained the sun red today
All things wash away
And they all fall down
But blood stained the sun today
All things wash away
And they all fall down
But blood stained the sun today


And now I wait my whole lifetime for you
And now I wait my whole lifetime for you
I ride the dirt, I ride the tide for you
I search the outside, search inside for you
To take back what you left me
I know I’ll always burn to be
The one who seeks so I may find
And now I wait my whole lifetime
Outlaw of torn
Outlaw of torn
And I’m torn
So on I wait my whole lifetime for you
So on I wait my whole lifetime for you
The more I search, the more my need for you
The more I bless, the more I bleed for you
You make me smash the clock and feel
I’d rather die behind the wheel
Time was never on my side
So on I wait my whole lifetime
Outlaw of torn
Outlaw of torn
Outlaw of torn
And I’m torn
Hear me
And if I close my mind in fear
Please pry it open
See me
And if my face becomes sincere
Beware
Hold me
And when I start to come undone
Stitch me together
Save me
And when you see me strut
Remind me of what left this outlaw torn

Fortune, fame
Mirror vain
Gone insane
But the memory remains
Heavy rings on fingers wave
Another star denies the grave
See the nowhere crowd, cry the nowhere tears of honor
Like twisted vines that grow
That hide and swallow mansions whole
And dim the light of an already faded prima donna
Fortune, fame
Mirror vain
Gone insane...
Fortune, fame
Mirror vain
Gone insane...
But the memory remains
Heavy rings hold cigarettes
Up to lips that time forgets
While the Hollywood sun sets behind your back
And can't the band play on?
Just listen, they play my song
Ash to ash
Dust to dust
Fade to black
Fortune, fame
Mirror vain
Gone insane...
Fortune, fame
Mirror vain
Gone insane...
Dance, little tin goddess

Little tin goddess
Ash to ash
Dust to dust
Fade to black
Fortune, fame
Mirror vain
Gone insane...

Ash to ash
Dust to dust
Fade to black...

Lay beside me, tell me what they've done
Speak the words I wanna hear, to make my demons run
The door is locked now, but it's opened if you're true
If you can understand the me, then I can understand the you
Lay beside me, under wicked sky
Through black of day, dark of night, we share this paralyze
The door cracks open but there's no sun shining through
Black heart scarring darker still, but there's no sun shining through
No, there's no sun shining through
No, there's no sun shining...
What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you?
What I've felt, what I've known
Sick and tired, I stand alone
Could you be there? 'Cause I'm the one who waits for you
Or are you unforgiven, too?
Come lay beside me, this won't hurt, I swear
She loves me not, she loves me still, but she'll never love again
She lay beside me but she'll be there when I'm gone
Black heart scarring darker still, yes, she'll be there when I'm gone
Yes, she'll be there when I'm gone
Dead sure she'll be there...
What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you?
What I've felt, what I've known
Sick and tired, I stand alone
Could you be there? 'Cause I'm the one who waits for you
Or are you unforgiven, too?
Lay beside me, tell me what I've done
The door is closed, so are your eyes
But now I see the sun, now I see the sun
Yes, now I see it
What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you?
What I've felt, what I've known
So sick and tired, I stand alone
Could you be there? 'Cause I'm the one who waits,
The one who waits for you....
Oh, what I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you? (so I dub thee Unforgiven)
Oh, what I've felt...
Oh, what I've known...
I take this key (never free...)
And I bury it (never me...) in you
Because you're unforgiven, too...
Never free...
Never me...
'Cause you're unforgiven, too...
Oh


I look at you, then you me
Hungry and thirsty are we
Holding the lion's share
Holding the key
Holding me back 'cause I'm striving to be
Better than you
Better than you [Jason]
Better than you
Better than you [Jason]
Lock horns, I push and I strive
Some how I feel more alive
Bury the need for it
Bury the seed
Bury me deep when there's no will to be
Better than you
Better than you [Jason]
Better than you
Better than you [Jason]

So wake up, sleepy one
It’s time to save your world
Steal dreams and give to you
Shoplift a thought or two
All children touch the sun
Burn fingers one by one, by one
Will this earth be good to you?
Keep you clean or stain through?
So wake up, sleepy one
It’s time to save your world
You’re where the wild things are
Toy soldiers off to war
Big eyes to open soon
Believing all under sun and moon
But does heaven know you’re here?
And did they give you smiles or tears?
No, no tears
Will this earth be good to you?
Keep you clean or stain through?
So wake up, sleepy one
It’s time to save your world
You’re where the wild things are
Toy soldiers off to war
You swing your rattle down
(Hand puppets storm the beach
Fire trucks trapped out of reach)
Call to arms, the trumpets sound
(Hand puppets storm the beach
Fire trucks trapped out of reach
All clowns reinforce the rear
Slingshots fire into the air)
Toy horses start the charge
(All clowns reinforce the rear
Slingshots fire into the air
Stuffed bears hold the hill till death
Crossfire from the marionettes)
Robot chessmen standing guard
(Stuffed bears hold the hill till death
Crossfire from the marionettes
We shall never surrender)
All you children touch the sun
Burn your fingers one by one
Will this earth be good to you?
Keep you clean or stain through?
So wake up, sleepy one
It’s time to save your world
You’re where the wild things are
Toy soldiers off to war
Off to war
Off to war
So close your little eyes


There’s a black cloud overhead
That’s me
And the poison ivy chokes the tree
Again it’s me
I’m the filthy one on Bourbon Street you walk on by
I’m the little boy that pushes hard and makes it cry
There’s a dirty needle in your child
Stick me
Empty bottles still in hand, still dead
Still me
I’m the suit and tie that bleeds the street and still wants more
I’m the forty-five that’s in your mouth, I’m a dirty, dirty whore
Look, it’s me
The one who can’t be free
Much too young to focus
But too old to see
Hey, look, it’s me
What no one wants to see
See what you brought this world
Just what you want to see
Hey, Ma
Hey, Mom! Look, it’s me
And he wants to be called “Father” now
Me again, me
The marks inside your arms spell me
Spell only me
I’m the nothing face that plants the bomb and strolls away
I’m the one who doesn’t look quite right as children play
Look, it’s me
The one who can’t be free
Much too young to focus
But too old to see
Hey, look, it’s me
What no one wants to see
See what you brought this world
Just what you want you want to see
Hey, Ma
Hey, Ma! Look, it’s me
Look up to me,
What to be and what to fear
Look up to me
Look, it’s me. Like what you hear?
See right through me
See the one who can’t be free
See right through me
Look, it’s me, what no one wants to see
Now see the black cloud up ahead
That’s me
And this poison ivy chokes the tree
Again it’s me
And I’m the filthy one on Bourbon Street you walk on by
I’m the little boy that pushes, pushes, makes it cry
Look, it’s me
The one who can’t be free
Much too young to focus
But too old to see
Hey, look, it’s me
What no one wants to see
See what you brought this world
Just what you want to see
Hey, Ma
Hey, Ma! Look, it’s me
Hey, Ma
Hey, Ma! Look, it’s me


My eyes seek reality
My fingers seek my veins
Theres a dog at your back step
He must come in from the rain
I fall cause I let go
The net below has rot away
So my eyes seek reality
And my fingers seek my veins
The trash fire is warm
But nowhere safe from the storm
And I can't bare to see
What I've let me be
So wicked and worn
So as I write to you
Of what is done and to do
Maybe you'll understand
And won't cry for this man
'Cause low man is due
Please forgive me
My eyes seek reality
My fingers feel for faith
Touch clean with a dirty hand
I touched the clean to the waste
The trash fire is warm
But nowhere safe from the storm
And I can't bare to see
What I've let me be
So wicked and worn
So as I write to you
Of what is done and to do
Maybe you'll understand
And won't cry for this man
'Cause low man is due
Please forgive me
Please forgive me
Please forgive me
So low the sky is all I see
All I want from you is forgive me
So you bring this poor dog in from the rain
Though he just wants right back out again
And I cry, to the alley way
Confess all to the rain
But I lie, lie straight to the mirror
The one I've broken, to match my face
The trash fire is warm
But nowhere safe from the storm
And I can't bare to see
What I've let me be
So wicked and worn
So as I write to you (yeah)
Of what is done and to do (yeah)
Maybe you'll understand
And won't cry for this man
'Cause low man is due
Please forgive me
Please forgive me
So low the sky is all I see
All I want from you is forgive me
So you bring this poor dog in from the rain
Though he just wants right back out again
My eyes seek reality
My fingers seek my veins

Why cure the fever?
What ever happened to sweat?

And they plan to pick you clean
And satisfaction this way comes

Dolls of voodoo all stuck with pins
One for each of us and our sins
So you lay us in a line
Push your pins, they make us humble
Only you can tell in time
If we fall or merely stumble
But tell me
Can you heal what father's done?
Or fix this hole in a mother's son?
Can you heal the broken worlds within?
Can you strip away so we may start again?
Tell me
Can you heal what father's done?
Or cut this rope and let us run?
Just when all seems fine
And I'm pain free
You jab another pin
Jab another pin in me
Mirror, mirror upon thy wall
Break the spell or become the doll
See you sharpening the pins
So the holes will remind us
We're just the toys in the hands of another
And in time the needles turn from shine to rust
But tell me
Can you heal what father's done?
Or fix this hole in a mother's son?
Can you heal the broken worlds within?
Can you strip away so we may start again?
Tell me
Can you heal what father's done?
Or cut this rope and let us run?
Just when all seems fine
And I'm pain free
You jab another pin
Jab another pin in me
Jab it
Here come the pins
Blood for face
Sweat for dirt
Three X's for the stone
To break this curse
A ritual's due
I believe I'm not alone
Shell of shotgun
Pint of gin
Numb us up to shield the pins
Renew our faith
Which way we can
To fall in love with life again
To fall in love with life again
To fall in love with life again
To fall in love
To fall in love
To fall in love with life again
So tell me
Can you heal what father's done?
Or fix this hole in a mother's son?
Can you heal the broken worlds within?
Can you strip away so we may start again?
Tell me
Can you heal what father's done?
Or cut this rope and let us run?
Just when all seems fine
And I'm pain free
You jab another pin
Jab another pin in me
No more pins in me
No more, no more pins in me
No more, no more pins in me
No more, no more, no more
No, no, no

I feel so good, I feel so fine
Love that little lady, always on my mind
She gives me love every night and day
Never gonna leave her, never going away
Someone to love me, you know she makes me feel alright!
Someone to need me, love me every single day!
I feel so happy since I met that girl
When we're making love it's something out of this world
It feels so good to know that she's all mine
Gonna love that woman till the end of time
Someone to live for, I'll love her till the end of time!
She makes me feel happy, it's good to know that she's all mine
I am the world that hides
The universal secret of all time
Destruction of the empty spaces
Is my one and only crime
I lived a thousand times
I found out what it means to be believed
The thoughts and images
The unborn child never was conceived
You gotta believe me!
Hey! I'm talkin' to you!
Well, I know it hard for you
To know the reason why
And I know you'll understand
When it's time to die
I don't believe the knife you have
Will be the only one
You have to let your body sleep
To let your soul live on, Ha Ha!!
Feel so happy since I met that girl
When we're making love, it's something out of this world
Feel so good to know that she's all mine
Gonna love that woman till the end of time
Someone to live for, love her till the end of time!
She makes me feel happy, it's good to know she's all mine,
She's all mine, yeah!


On a long and lonesome highway east of Omaha
You can listen to the engines moanin' out it's one note song
You can think about the woman or the girl you knew the night before
But your thoughts will soon be wandering the way they always do
When you riding sixteen hours with nothing much to do
And you don't feel much like ridin', you just wish the trip was through
Here I am, on the road again
There I am, up on the stage
Here I go, playin' star again
There I go, turn the page
You walk into a restaurant, strung out from the road
And you feel the eyes upon you, as you're shaking off the cold
You pretend it doesn't bother you, but you just want to explode
And most times you can't hear 'em talk, other times you can
All the same old cliches, "Is it woman? Is it man?"
And you always seem outnumbered, you don't dare make a stand
Make your stand
Here I am, on the road again
There I am, up on the stage
Here I go, playin' star again
There I go, turn the page
Out there in the spotlight you're a million miles away
Every ounce of energy you try to give away
As the sweat pours out your body, like the music that you play
Later in the evening, as you lie awake in bed
With the echoes of the amplifiers ringin' in your head
You smoke the days last cigarette, rememberin' what she said
What she said
Here I am, on the road again
There I am, up on the stage
Here I go, playin' star again
There I go, turn the page
There I go, turn that page
There I go, yeah
There I go, yeah
There I go, yeah
Here I go, yeah
There I go
There I go
And I'm gone


Ah
Yeah
Die, die, die my darling
Don't utter a single word
Die, die, die my darling
Just shut your pretty eyes
I'll be seeing you again
Yeah, I'll be seeing you, in hell
So don't cry to me oh baby
Your future's in an oblong box
Don't cry to me oh baby
You should have seen it a-coming on
Don't cry to me oh baby
Had to know it was in your card
Don't cry to me oh baby
Dead-end soul for a dead-end girl
Don't cry to me oh baby
And now your life drains on the floor
Don't cry to me oh baby

Don't utter a single word
Die, die, die my darling
Just shut your pretty mouth

Had to know it was in your card
Don't cry to me oh baby
Dead-end soul for a dead-end girl
Don't cry to me oh baby
And now your life drains on the floor
Don't cry to me oh baby
Die, die, die my darling
Don't utter a single word
Die, die, die my darling
Shut your pretty mouth

[a medley of the songs "Satan's Fall", "Curse of the Pharaohs", "A Corpse Without Soul", "Into the Coven", "Evil"]
Satan's Fall
They're walking by the night
The moon has frozen blue
Long black coats a shelter for the rain
Their load must get through
Now bats are leaving their trees
They're joining the call
Seven satanic Hell preachers
Heading for the hall
Bringing the blood of a newborn child
Got to succeed, if not it's Satan's fall
Curse Of The Pharaohs
Away out in Egypt in the valley of kings
Where the mummified pharaohs
Pretend dead in their sleep
Don't touch, never ever steal
Unless you're in for the kill
Or you'll be hit by the curse of the pharaohs
Yes you'll be hit and the curse is on you
The curse of the pharaohs can be so deadly
Just destroying your future
Makin' it all shady
Don't touch, never ever steal
Unless you're in for the kill
Or you'll be hit by the curse of the pharaohs
Yes you'll be hit and the curse is on you
A Corpse Without Soul
Listen, I'm a corpse, I'm a corpse
I'm a corpse without soul
Satan, he's taken, he's taken
He's taken his toll
And he took it on me
I, I'm trapped, I'm trapped
I'm trapped in his spell
Tonight, I'm going, I'm going
I'm going to Hell, inside his spell
Into The Coven
Howl like a wolf
And a witch will open the door
Follow me and meet our high priestess
Come, come into my coven
And become Lucifer's child
Undress until you're naked
And put on this white coat
Take this white cross and go to the center of the ring
Come, come into my coven
And become Lucifer's child
Evil
I was born on the cemetery
Under the sign of the moon
Raised from my grave by the dead
And I was made a mercenary
In the legions of Hell
Now I'm king of pain, I'm insane
You know my only pleasure
Is to hear you cry
I'd love to hear you cry
I'd love to see you die
And I'll be the first
To watch your funeral
And I'll be the last to leave
I'd love to hear you cry
And when you're down beyond the ground
I'll dig up your body again
And make love to shame
Oh lady cry, and say goodbye
Oh lady cry, and say goodbye
You've gotta say goodbye
'Cause I will eat your mind


Clock strikes twelve and moondrops burst
Out at you from their hiding place
Like acid and oil on a madman's face
His reason tends to fly away
Like lesser birds on the four winds
Like silver scrapes in May
And now the sand's become a crust
Most of you have gone away
Come Susie dear, let's take a walk
Just out there upon the beach
I know you'll soon be married
And you'll want to know where winds come from
Well it's never said at all
On the map that Carrie reads
Behind the clock back there you know
At the Four Winds Bar
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Four winds at the Four Winds Bar
Two doors locked and windows barred
One door left to take you in
The other one just mirrors it
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hellish glare and inference
The other one's a duplicate
The Queenly flux, eternal light
Or the light that never warms
Yes the light that never, never warms
Or the light that never
Never warms
Never warms
Never warms
The clock strikes twelve and moondrops burst
Out at you from their hiding place
Miss Carrie nurse and Susie dear
Would find themselves at Four Winds Bar
It's the nexus of the crisis
And the origin of storms
Just the place to hopelessly
Encounter time and then came me
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Call me Desdinova
Eternal light
These gravely digs of mine
Will surely prove a sight
And don't forget my dog
Fixed and consequent
Astronomy...a star


As I was goin' over the Cork and Kerry mountains

Train roll on, on down the line
Won't you please take me far away
Now, I feel the wind blow outside my door
I leave my woman at home
Tuesday's gone with the wind
My baby's gone with the wind
And I don't know oh where I'm going
I just want to be left alone
When this train ends, I'll try again

But somehow, I've got to carry on
Tuesday's gone with the wind
Tuesday's gone with the wind
Tuesday's gone with the wind
My baby's gone with the wind[repeat "Train roll on" and "Tuesday's gone" etc., in various combinations until the end]


From where I stand I see
Pain suffering and misery
The more I see the more I see
The less the less I believe
From where I stand I see
Hate violence and war
The more I see the more I see
The less the less I believe


I've gotta see you moving fast, see you come my way.
See the dreams, I hope they last, never fade away.
Gotta see the lights above, make it loud tonight.
Gotta set it all afire, set it all alight.
See the flashing lights, hear the thunder roar,
I am gonna set you all alight.
Gotta make it man, I ain't got a choice,
Gotta fill this hall tonight.
Helpless, helpless, helpless, helpless.
I don't know what I'm gonna do, maybe not tonight.
Gotta set you all afire, gotta treat you right.
I can see the flashing lights, lit before your love.
Gotta hear the thunder roar, coming from above.
See the flashing lights, hear the thunder roar,
I am gonna set you all alight.
Gotta make it man, I ain't got a choice,
Gotta fill this hall tonight.
Helpless, helpless, helpless, helpless.
I can see the stars, I can see what's going on.
Every night alone I sing my song just for fun.
Only time will tell if I'll make it myself someday.
This stage is mine, music is my destiny.
Cannot squeeze the life from me.
I can see the stars, I can see what's going on.
Every night alone I sing my song just for fun.
Only time will tell if I'll make it myself someday.
This stage is mine, music is my destiny.
Cannot squeeze the life from me.


Look out at the darkness, and you will see.
Just call my name and I'll be there.
You cannot touch me, you would not dare.
I am the chill that's in the air.
And I try to get through to you, in my own special way,
As the barriers crumble at the end of the day.
Dark rivers are flowing back into the past.
You are the fish for which I cast.
And what of the future, what is to be.
As the rivers flow into the sea.
And I try to get through to you, in my own special way,
As the barriers crumble at the end of the day.
Do not take for granted, powers out there.
Don't step into the demon's lair.
Time is an illusion, rising from time.
Steep is the mountain which we climb.
And I try to get through to you, in my own special way,
As the barriers crumble at the end of the day.


Motives changing, day to day,
The fire increases, masks decay.
I look at the river, white foam floats down,
The body's poisoned, gotta sit tight.
The wait, the wait, the wait, the wait.
After wakening, silence grows,
The screams subside, distortion shows.
Mutant thoughts of bad mouthed news,
Is just another birth of distorted views.
The wait, the wait, the wait, the wait.
The wait, the wait, the wait, the wait.


Look inside and you will see,
The words are cutting deep inside my brain.
Thunder burning, quickly burning,
Knife of words is driving me insane, insane yeah.
Raven black is on my track,
He shows me how to neutralize the knife.
Show to me in surgery,
The art of fighting words to conquer life, conquer life yeah.
Now the wicked lance of fear,
Is driving from my heady mountain brain.
Crash course in brain surgery,
Has stopped the bloody knife of words again yeah, yeah, yeah.

My mother was a witch, she was burned alive.
Thankless little bitch, for the tears I cried.
Take her down now, don't want to see her face
All blistered and burnt, can't hide my disgrace.
Twenty-seven, everyone was nice.
Gotta see 'em make 'em pay the price.
See their bodies out on the ice.
Take my time.
Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man, yes I am.
As I watched my mother die, I lost my head.
Revenge now I sought, to break with my bread.
Taking no chances, you come with me.
I'll split you to the bone, help set you free.
Twenty-seven, everyone was nice.
Gotta see 'em make 'em pay the price.
See their bodies out on the ice.
Take my time.
Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man, yes I am.
On with the action now, I'll strip your pride.
I'll spread your blood around, I'll see you ride.
Your face is scarred with steel, wounds deep and neat.
Like a double dozen before ya, smells so sweet.
Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man.
I'll make my residence, I'll watch your fire.
You can come with me, sweet desire.
My face is long forgot, my face not my own.
Sweet and timely whore, take me home.
Am I evil? Yes I am.

Let us have peace, let us have life,
Let us escape the cruel night.
Let us have time, let the sun shine,
Let us beware the deadly sign.
The day is coming, Armageddon's near,
Inferno's coming, can we survive the blitzkrieg.
The blitzkrieg, the blitzkrieg.
Save us from fate, save us from hate,
Save ourselves before it's too late.
Come to our need, hear our plea,
Save ourselves before the earth bleeds.
The day is dawning, the time is near,
Aliens calling, can we survive the blitzkrieg.


Breadfan, open up your mind, open up your purse,
Open up your bones, never, never gonna lose it.
Breadfan, take it all away, never give an inch,
Gotta make a mint, gotta make me a million.
Breadfan, you got it wrong, some long time friend's
Gonna lose it in the end, who's a fool.
Seagull, give it all away, stay a bird, stay a man,
Stay a ghost, stay what you wanna be.
Loser, give it all away, never stay with the winner,
With the man with all the filthy money.
Come on, keep it on the side, with a ride on a record,
On the top if you're gonna be a bad boy.
Breadfan, you got it wrong, some long time friend's
Gonna lose it in the end, who's a fool.

Now I see his face, I see his smile.
Such a lonely place, no golden mile.
Eyes tell of morbid tales, of his black heart.
His deeds through ages past tell of his part.
See his face, see his smile.
Time to die, o-oh, no-oh, no-oh.
Angel from below, change my dreams.
I want for glory's hour, for wealth's esteem.
I wish to sell my soul, to be reborn.
I wish for earthly riches, don't want no crown of thorns.
See his face, see his smile.
Time to die, o-oh, o-oh, no-oh.
I was born a fool, don't want to stay that way.
Devil take my soul, with diamonds you repay.
I don't care for heaven, so don't you look for me to cry.
And I will burn in hell, from the day I die.
See his face, see his smile.
Time to die, o-oh, no-oh, no.


Sleeping very soundly on a Saturday morning,
I was dreaming I was Al Capone.
Rumours going round, gotta clear out of town,
Smell like a dry fishbone.
Here come the law, gonna break down the door,
Carry me away once more.
Never, never, never want it anymore,
Gotta get away from this stone cold floor.
Crazy, stone cold crazy, you know.
Rainy afternoon, ought to kill a typhoon,
And she's playing on my slide trombone.
Anymore, anymore, cannot take it anymore,
Gotta get away from this stone cold floor.
Crazy, stone cold crazy, you know.
Walking down the street, shooting people that I meet,
Fully loaded Tommy gun.
Here come the deputy, try fucking getting me,
Gotta fucking get up and run.
They got the sirens loose, I ran right out of juice.
They're gonna put me in a cell,
If I can't go to heaven, let me go to hell.
Crazy, stone cold crazy, you know, yeah.

Sound of gunfire comes through the night,
Killing and hatred, it's a terrible sight.
Reports come in of the heavy attack,
Message is seen, we're moving back.
Preparations are made for the journey back,
It's a survival, supplies are packed.
No more nights in this eternal hell,
Destination is simple, we move out.
Killing time - You left from the line.
Killing time - Your turn to kill.
Killing time - What do you say?
Killing time - Aaha, killing time.
And he knew what he needed to keep us alive,
No time for cowardice, kill and survive.
Like a killer kid with a switchblade knife,
Nasty word, he'll take your life.
The silence is over, they attack again,
Killing and hatred drive me insane.

If I could have my wasted days back
Would I use them to get back on track?
Stop to warm at Karma's burning
Or look ahead, but keep on turning?

To deal with what I shouldn't know?
Could I have my wasted days back
Would I use them to get back on track?

These are the eyes that can't see me
These are the hands that drop your trust
These are the boots that kick you around
This is the tongue that speaks on the inside
These are the ears that ring with hate
This is the face that I'll never change
This is the fist that grinds you down
This is the voice of silence no more
These are the legs that in circles run
This is the beating you'll never know
These are the lips that taste no freedom
This is the feel that's not so safe
This is the face you'll never change
This is the god that ain't so pure
This is the god that is not pure
This is the voice of silence no more
We the people
Are we the people?
We the people
Are we the people?
Some kind of monster
Some kind of monster

This monster lives
This is the face that stones you cold
This is the moment that needs to breathe
These are the claws that scratch these wounds
This is the pain that never leaves
This is the tongue that whips you down
This is the burden of every man
These are the screams that pierce your skin
This is the voice of silence no more
This is the test of flesh and soul
This is the trap that smells so good
This is the flood that drains these eyes
These are the looks that chill to the bone
These are the fears that swing over head
These are the weights that hold you down
This is the end that will never end
This is the voice of silence no more

I see my reflection in the window
It looks different, so different than what you see
Projecting Judgement on the world
This house is clean baby
This house is clean
Am I who I think I am?
Am I who I think I am?
Am I who I think I am?
Look out my window and see it's gone wrong
Court is in session and I slam my gavel down
I'm judge and I'm jury and I'm executioner too
Projector, Protector, Rejector, Infector, Projector
Infrector, Injector, Defector, Rejector
I see my reflection in the window
This window clean inside, dirty on the out
I'm looking different than me
This house is clean baby
This house is clean
Am I who I think I am?
Am I who I think I am?
Am I who I think I am?
Look out my window and see it's gone wrong
Court is in session and I slam my gavel down
I'm judge and I'm jury and I'm executioner too
Projector, Protector, Rejector, Infector, Projector
Infrector, Injector, Defector, Rejector
I drink from the cup of denial
I'm judging the world from my throne
I drink from the cup of denial
I'm judging the world from my throne


Invisible kid
Never see what he did
Got stuck where he hid
Fallen through the grid
Invisible kid
Got a place of his own
Where he’ll never be known
Inward he’s grown
Invisible kid
Locked away in his brain
From the shame and the pain
World down the drain
Invisible kid
Suspicious of your touch
Don’t want no crutch
But it’s all too much
I hide inside
I hurt inside
I hide inside, but I’ll show you...
I’m OK, just go away
Into the distance let me fade
I’m OK, just go away
I’m OK, but please don’t stray too far
Open up your heart
I’m beating right here
Open your mind
I’m being right here, right now
Open your heart
I’m beating right here
Open your mind
I’m being right here, right now
Ooh, what a good boy you are
Out of the way and you’re kept to yourself
Ooh, can’t you see that he’s not here
He doesn’t want the attention you give
Ooh, unplugging from it all
Invisible kid floats alone in his room
Ooh, what a quiet boy you are
He looks so calm floating ‘round and ‘round in himself


The motherfuckers got in my head
Trying to make me someone else instead
It's my world now
Mama, why's it rainin' in my room
Cheer up boy clouds will move on soon
Heavy fog got me lost inside
Gonna sit right back and enjoy this ride
It's my world now
You can't have it
It's my world, It's my world
It's my world
I'm out of my head, out of my head
Get 'em out of my head, out of my head
Get 'em out
Who's in charge of my head today
Dancin' devils in angels way
It's my time now
Look out motherfuckers here I come
Gonna make my head home
The sons of bitches tried to take my head
Tried to make me someone else instead
It's my world now
You can't have it
It's my world, It's my world
It's my world
I'm out of my head, out of my head
Get 'em out of my head, out of my head
Get 'em out
Not only do I not know the answer
I don't even know what the question is
God it feels like it only rains on me
Not only do I not know the answer
I don't even know what the question is
I'm out of my head, out of my head
Get 'em out of my head, out of my head
Get 'em out
Enough's enough


I won't go away
Right here I'll stay
Stand silent in flames
Stand tall 'till it fades
Shoot me again
I ain't dead yet
Shoot me again
All these shots I take
I spit back at you
All the shit you fake
Comes back to haunt you
All the shots
All the shots I take
What difference did I make?
All the shots I take
I spit back at you
I won't go away, with a bullet in my back
Right here I'll stay, with a bullet in my back
Shoot me take a shot
I'll stand on my own, with a bullet in my back
I'm stranded and sold, with a bullet in my back
I bite my tongue
Trying not to shoot back
No compromise
My heart won't pump the other way
Wake the sleeping giant
Wake the beast
Wake the sleeping dog
No, Let him sleep


[x2]
Wash your back so you won't stab mine
Get in bed with your own kind
Live your life so you don't see mine
Drape your back so you won't shine[x2]
Oh then she holds my hand
And I lie to get a smile[x4]
Using what I want
To get what you want
Oh Sweet Amber
How sweet are you?
How sweet does it get?
How sweet are you?
How sweet does it get?[x2]
Chase the rabbit, fetch the stick
She rolls me over 'til I'm sick
She deals in habits, deals in pain
I run away but I'm back again
Oh then she holds my hand
And I lie to get a smile
And she squeezes tighter
I still lie to get a smile[x4]
Using what I want
To get what you want
Oh Sweet Amber
How sweet are you?
How sweet does it get?
How sweet are you?
How sweet does it get?[x2]
She holds the pen that spells the end
She traces me and draws me in
Ooh Sweet Amber
Ooh Sweet Amber
How sweet are you?
How sweet does it get?
How sweet are you?
How sweet does it get?
(It's never as sweet as it seems)


Been here before
Been here before
Been here before
Been here before
Been here before
Been here before
Been here before couldn't say I liked it
But do I start writing all this down?
Just let me plug you into my world
Can't you help me be uncrazy?
Name this for me, heat the cold air
Take the chill off of my life
And if I could I'd turn my eyes
To look inside to see what's comin'
It comes alive, It comes alive, It comes alive
And I die a little more
It comes alive, It comes alive, It comes alive
Each moment here I die a little more
Oooh, I die, I die, I die a little more
Then the unnamed feeling
It comes alive
Then the unnamed feeling
Takes me away
Been here before
Been here before
Been here before
Been here before
Been here before
Been here before
I'm frantic in your soothing arms
I can not sleep in this down filled world
I've found safety in this loneliness
But I can not stand it anymore
Cross my heart hope not to die
Swallow evil, ride the sky
Lose myself in a crowded room
You fool, you fool, it will be here soon
It comes alive, It comes alive, It comes alive
And I die a little more
It comes alive, It comes alive, It comes alive
Each moment here I die a little more
Oooh, I die, I die, I die a little more
Then the unnamed feeling
It comes alive
Then the unnamed feeling
Treats me this way
And I wait for this train
Toes over the line
And then the unnamed feeling
Takes me away
It takes me
Then the unnamed feeling
It comes alive, yeayeah
Then the unnamed feeling
Takes me away
Yeah, takes me away
Get the fuck out of here
I just wanna get the fuck away from me
I rage, I glaze, I hurt, I hate
I hate it all, why? Why? Why me?
I cannot sleep with a head like this
I wanna cry, I wanna scream
I rage, I glaze, I hurt, I hate
I wanna hate it all away
Then the unnamed feeling
It comes alive, yeayeah
Then the unnamed feeling
Treats me this way
Then I wait for this train
My toes are over the line
Then the unnamed feeling
Takes me away
Yeah, it takes me away
Then the unnamed feeling
It comes alive
Then the unnamed feeling
Takes me away


Tear it down
Strip the layers off
My turpentine
Old paint, old looks
Cover up the past
White heat, white light
Super white bones
Bones of you and I
Pure if  I... can't you help me?
Pure if  I... won't you help me?
Purify you and I
Purify you and I
Pure if  I... can't you help me?
Pure if  I... won't you help me?
Purify you and I
Purify you and I
Truth and dare
Peeling back the skin
Acid wash
Ghost white
Ultra clean
Wanna be skeleton
Clear eyes
Diamond eyes
Strip the past of mine
My sweet turpentine
I can find the dirt on anything
I can find the dirt on anything
I ain't  dancing with your skeletons
I ain't  dancing with what might have been


All within my hands
Squeeze it in, crush it down
All within my hands
Hold it dear, hold it suffocate
All within my hands
Love to death, smack you 'round and 'round and
All within my hands
Beware
Love is control
I'll die if I let go
Hate me now
Kill all within my hands
Hate me now
Crush all within my hands
Squeeze all within my hands
Choke all within my hands
Hate me now
Trap all within my hands
Hurry up and hate me now
Kill all within my hands
All within my hands
Take your fear, pump me up
All within my hands
Let you run, then I pull your leash
All within my hands
Under thumb, under to myself
All within my hands
Beware
Hate me now
Kill all within my hands
Hate me now
Crush all within my hands
Squeeze all within my hands
Choke all within my hands
Hate me now
Trap all within my hands
Hurry up and hate me now
Kill all within my hands again
I'll die if I let go
Control is love, love is control
I'll fall if I let go
Control is love, love is control
I will only let you breath
My air that you receive
Then we'll see if I let you love me
Kill Kill Kill Kill Kill


Like a siren in my head that always threatens to repeat
Like a blind man that is strapped into the speeding driver’s seat
Like a face that learns to speak
When all it knew was how to bite
Like a misery that keeps me focused though I've gone astray
Like an endless nightmare that I must awaken from each day
Like conviction
A premonition
Not worthy of, so I deny…I deny 
I blind my eyes and try to force it all into place
I stitch them up, see not my fall from grace
I blind my eyes, I hide and feel it passing me by
I open just in time to say goodbye
Almost like your life
Almost like your endless fight
Curse the day is long
Realize you don't belong
Disconnect somehow
Never stop the bleeding now
Almost like your fight
And there it went
Almost like your life
Like a wound that keeps on bleeding to remind me not to think
Like a raging river drowning when I only need a drink
Like a poison that I swallow but I want the world to die
Like a release from prison that I didn't know I was in
Like a fight to live the past I prayed to leave 
From way back then
Like a general without a mission 
Until the war will start again…start again
I blind my eyes and try to force it all into place
I stitch them up, see not my fall from grace
I blind my eyes, I hide and feel it passing me by
I open just in time to say goodbye
Almost like your life
Almost like your endless fight
Curse the day is long
Realize you don't belong
Disconnect somehow
Never stop the bleeding now
Almost like your fight
And there it went
Almost like your life
Like a touch from hell to feel how hot 
That it can get if you get caught
Like a strike from heaven turns that key
And brings you straight down to your knees
Like a touch from hell to feel how hot
That it can get if I get caught
Like a strike from heaven to reprieve
That brings you straight down to your knees
Almost like your life
Almost like your endless fight
Curse the day is long
Realize you don't belong
Disconnect somehow
Never stop the bleeding now
Almost like your fight
And there it went
Almost like your life
That was just your life

You rise, you fall, you're down then you rise again
What don't kill you make you more strong
You rise, you fall, you're down then you rise again
What don't kill you make you more strong
Rise, fall, down, rise again
What don't kill you make you more strong
Rise, fall, down, rise again

Dawn, death, fight, final breath

They cut and rape me
Breaking your teeth on the hard life coming

Cutting your feet on the hard earth running
Show your scars
Breaking your life, broken, beat and scarred
But we die hard
Breaking your teeth on the hard life coming
Show your scars
Cutting your feet on the hard earth running
Show your scars
Bleeding your soul in a hard luck story
Show your scars
Spilling your blood in the hot sun's glory
Breaking your life, broken, beat and scarred
We die hard 
We die hard
We die hard


Born to push you around
Better just stay down
You pull away
He hits the flesh
You hit the ground
Mouth so full of lies
Tend to black your eyes
Just keep them closed
Keep praying
Just keep waiting
Waiting for the one
The day that never comes
When you stand up and feel the warmth
But the sunshine never comes
No, the sunshine never comes
Push you cross that line
Just stay down this time
Hide in yourself
Crawl in yourself
You’ll have your time
God I’ll make them pay
Take it back one day
I’ll end this day
I’ll splatter color on this gray
Waiting for the one
The day that never comes
When you stand up and feel the warmth
But the sunshine never comes
Love...is a four letter word
And never spoken here
Love...is a four letter word
Here in this prison
I suffer this no longer
I’ll put an end to this, I swear
This, I swear
The Sun will shine
This, I swear
This, I swear
This, I swear!


Luck. Runs. Out.
Crawl from the wreckage one more time
Horrific memory twists the mind
Dark, rutted, cold and hard to turn
Path of destruction, feel it burn
Still life
Incarnation
Still life
Infamy
Hallucination
Heresy
Still you run, what's to come?
What's to be?
'Cause we hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long
Feel us breathe upon your face
Feel us shift, every move we trace
Hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long, yeah
Luck. Runs. Out.
You crawl back in
But your luck runs out
1.2.
Luck. Runs. Out.
The light that is not light is here
To flush you out with your own fear
You hide, you hide, but will be found
Release your grip without a sound
Still life
Immolation
Still life
Infamy
Hallucination
Heresy
Still you run, what's to come?
What's to be?
'Cause we hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long
Feel us breathe upon your face
Feel us shift, every move we trace
Hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long, yeah
Luck. Runs. Out.
You crawl back in
But your luck runs out
Then you crawl back in
Into your obsession
Never to return
This is your confession
Hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long
Feel us breathe upon your face
Feel us shift, every move we trace
Hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long, yeah
Luck. Runs. Out.
You crawl back in
But your luck runs out
Your luck runs out


Sleep and dream of this
Death angel’s kiss
Brings final bliss
Completely
Empty they say
Death, won’t you let me stay? 
Empty they say
Death, hear me call your name
Call your name...
...Suicide
I’ve already died
You’re just the funeral 
I’ve been waiting for
...Cyanide
Living dead inside
Break this empty shell forevermore
Wait, wait patiently
Your death black wings
Unfolding sleep
Spreading o’er me
Empty they say
Death, won’t you let me stay? 
Empty they say
Death, hear me call your name
Call your name...
...Suicide
I’ve already died
You’re just the funeral 
I’ve been waiting for
...Cyanide
Living dead inside
Break this empty shell forevermore
Say, is that rain or are they tears?
That has stained your concrete face for years
The crying, weeping, shedding strife
Year after year, life after life
An air of freshly broken ground
A concrete angel lit right down
Upon the grave which swallows fast
It’s peace at last, oh peace at last!
Empty they say
Death, won’t you let me stay? 
Empty they say
Death, hear me call your name
Call your name...
...Suicide
I’ve already died
You’re just the funeral 
I’ve been waiting for
...Cyanide
Living dead inside
Break this empty shell forevermore
Forevermore
Forevermore
It’s just the funeral 
I’ve been waiting for


How could he know this new dawn's light
Would change his life forever?
Set sail to sea but pulled off course
By the light of golden treasure
Was he the one causing pain
With his careless dreaming?
Been afraid, always afraid
Of the things he's feeling
He could just be gone 
He would just sail on
He'll just sail on
How can I be lost
If I've got nowhere to go?
Search for seas of gold
How come it's got so cold?
How can I be lost
In remembrance I relive
And how can I blame you
When it's me I can't forgive?
These days drift on inside a fog
It's thick and suffocating
This seeking life outside its hell
Inside intoxicating
He's run aground like his life
Water much too shallow
Slipping fast down with his ship
Fading in the shadows now
A castaway
They've all gone away
They've gone away
How can I be lost
If I've got nowhere to go?
Search for seas of gold
How come it's got so cold?
How can I be lost
In remembrance I relive
And how can I blame you
When it's me I can't forgive?
Forgive me, forgive me not
Forgive me, forgive me not
Forgive me, forgive me not
Forgive me, forgive me
Why can't I forgive me?
Set sail to sea but pulled off course
By the light of golden treasure
How could he know this new dawn's light
Would change his life forever
How can I be lost
If I've got nowhere to go?
Search for seas of gold
How come it's got so cold?
How can I be lost
In remembrance I relive
So how can I blame you
When it's me I can't forgive?


When the world has turned its back
When the days have turned pitch black
When the fear abducts your tongue
When the fire's dead and gone
So what now?
Where go I?
When you think it's all said and done
When you are the ostracized
Selfish ridden dead goodbyes
Twisting of the tourniquet
When the pieces never fit
So what now?
Where go I?
When you think it's all said and done
Bow down
Sell your soul to me
I will set you free
Pacify your demons
Bow down
Surrender unto me
Submit infectiously
Sanctify your demons
Into abyss
You don't exist
Cannot resist
The Judas kiss
When the storm has blacked your sky
Intuition crucify
When the ego strips your reign
Assassinate the living flame
So what now?
Where go I?
When you think it's all said and done
Venom of a life insane
Bites into your fragile veins
Internalize and decimate
Patronize and complicate
So what now?
Where go I?
When you think it's all said and done
Bow down
Sell your soul to me
I will set you free
Pacify your demons
Bow down
Surrender unto me
Submit infectiously
Sanctify your demons
Into abyss
You don't exist
Cannot resist
The Judas kiss
Judas lives recite this vow
I've become your new god now
Follow you from dawn of time
Whisper thoughts into your mind
Watched your towers hit the ground
Lured the children never found
Helped your kings abuse their crown
In the heart of evil man
Plant the seeds of my own plan
Strong and powerful will fall
Find a piece of me in all
Inside you all
So bow down
Sell your soul to me
I will set you free
Pacify your demons
Bow down
Surrender unto me
Submit infectiously
Sanctify your demons
Into abyss
You don't exist
Cannot resist
The Judas kiss


Claustrophobic
Crawl out of this skin
Heart explosive
Reach in, pull that pin
Fear thy name: Extermination
Desecrate inhale the fire
So we cross that line
Into the grips
Total eclipse
Suffer unto my apocalypse
Deadly vision
Prophecy reveal
Death magnetic
Pulling closer still
Fear thy name: Annihilation
Desolate inhale the fire
So we cross that line
Into the grips
Total eclipse
Suffer unto my apocalypse
My apocalypse...Go!
Crushing metal, ripping skin
Tossing body, mannequin
Spilling blood, bleeding gas
Mangle flesh, snapping spine
Dripping bloody valentine
Shatter face, spitting glass
Split apart
Split apart
Split apart
Spit
Spit it out
What makes me drift a little bit closer?
Dead man takes the steering wheel
What makes me know it’s time to cross over?
Born to repeat until I feel
See through the skin, bones they all rattle
Future and past, they disagree
Flesh falls away, bones they all shatter
I start to see the end. In. Me.
See the end in me
Claustrophobic
Climb out of this skin
Heart explosive
Reach in, pull that pin
Violate, annihilate
All wounds unto my eyes
Obliterate, exterminate
As life itself denied
Fear thy name as hell awakens
Destiny inhale the fire
But we’ve crossed that line
Into the grips
Total eclipse
Suffer unto my apocalypse
Tyrant awaken my apocalypse
Demon awaken my apocalypse
Heaven awaken my apocalypse
Suffer forever my apocalypse


I would cut my legs and tits off
When I think of Boris Karloff and Kinski
In the dark of the moon
It made me dream of Nosferatu
Trapped on the isle of Doctor Moreau
Oh wouldn’t it be lovely
I was thinking Peter Lorre
When things got pretty gory as I
Crossed to the Brandenburg Gate
I was feeling snappy perhaps I’d been napping
And I’d just ate
A following heart can tear you apart
On a midnight to 8 shift
A graveyard romance can only give one chance
As the tombstones weave and breathe
Feeling happy when my heart got beating
On a Sunday afternoon
I dreamt of breezes going through the treeses
And stars were still illumed
I have three hearts that I keep apart
Trying to relate
To normal feelings and the nightime reelings
And some absynthe drunk so late
The cook got drunk and all the whores they shrunk
Onto the size of dessert plates
But me I’m happy cause I got my little nappy
And some opium to set me straight
I’m just a small town girl who wants to give it a whirl
While my looks still hold me straight
Straight up to illusion and fantasy’s fusion
Of reality mixed with drink
I’m just a small town girl who’s gonna give life a whirl
Looking at the Brandenburg Gate


I am a chorus of the voices
That gather up the magnets
Set before me
I attract you and repel you
A science of the heart
And blood and meaning
The coldness of most beauties
Is a challenge that our youth
Must quickly conquer
There is no time for guilt
Or second guessing, second guessing
Based on feeling
I am the truth, the beauty
That causes you to cross
Your sacred boundaries
I have no morals
Some think me cheap
And someone who despises
The normalcy of heartbreak
The purity of love
But I worship the young
And just formed angel
Who sits upon the pin of lust
Everything else
Bores me
I want to see your suicide
I want to see you give it up
Your life of reason
I want you on the floor
And in a coffin your soul shaking
I want to have you doubting
Every meaning you’ve amassed
Like a fortune
Oh throw it away
For worship someone
Who actively despises you
For worship someone
Who actively despises you
I am the root
I am the progress
I am the aggressor
I am the tablet
These ten stories
Worship
Worship
Pain and evil have their place
Sitting here beside me
I offer them to you as servants
Of the gold that you must give
Pain and evil have their place
Sitting here beside me
And I’ll offer them, I offer them to you
As servants of the gold
That you must give to me
I want to see your suicide
I want to see you give it up, give it up
Your your life of reason
I want to see you on the floor
And in a coffin, soul shaking
Soul shaking
I want to have you doubting
Every meaning you’ve amassed
Like a fortune, like a fortune
Throw it away
For worship of someone who actively despises you
Who actively despises you


If I pump out blood in the sunshine
Oil on the wheel
That is blasted and busted away
A nail or a little piece of glass
A little piece of glass
A little piece of glass
Swarming like bees over the air
Off the pump off the thing
The blood that I’m pumping away
Like bees over the air
Off the pump
Off the thing
The blood that I’m pumping away
Off the pump
Off the thing
The blood that I’m pumping away
If I pump blood in the sunshine
And you wear a leather box with azaleas
And I pump more blood
And it seeps through my skin
Will you adore the river
The stream, the trickle
The tributary of my heart
As I pump more blood
And it seeps through my skin
Will you adore the river
The stream, the trickle
The tributary of my heart
If I’m pumping blood
Like a common state worker
If I waggle my ass like a dark prostitute
Would you think less of me
And my coagulating heart
Waggle my ass like a dark prostitute
Coagulating heart
Pumping blood
Would you top me off
Would you top me off as I deepen a curtsy
While you yell out, “mercy”
We grow apart
Would you rip and cut me
Use a knife on me
Be shocked at the boldness
The coldness of this little heart
Tied up in leather
Would you take the measure
Of the blood that I pump
In the manic confusion of love
Supreme violation
Supreme violation
“Oh, ah, ah, ah Jack I beseech you”
“Oh Jack I beseech you”
Supreme violation
Blood in the foyer
The bathroom
The tea room
The kitchen, with her knives splayed
I will swallow your sharpest cutter
Like a colored man’s dick
Blood spurting from me
“Oh Jack, Jack I beseech…”
“Jack, I beseech you, I beseech…”
In the end it was an ordinary heart
“Oh Jack I beseech you”
As I scream out my pain
In the end it was an ordinary heart
In the end, in the end, in the end
It was an ordinary heart
“Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack I beseech you”
Supreme violation... Oh
“Jack, Jack, Jack I beseech you”
I call out your name
Blood in the foyer, the bathroom,
The tea room, the kitchen
And knives splayed
I swallow your sharpest cutter
Like a colored man’s dick
Blood spurting from me
Blood spurting from me
“Oh Jack”
“Oh Jack, I beseech ya”
In the end it was an ordinary heart
In the end it was an ordinary heart
Pumping blood


I’m built like you are
I have a dress and a train
Your snake cold lips
Make a harsh straight line
That echoes through my brain
You’re perfect
Let me lift a glass high
Let me follow in your footsteps
Let me follow in your sigh
Let me follow in your sigh
I’m a woman who likes men
But this is something else
I’ve never felt such stirrings
I feel like I
Was someone else
I wish you’d tie me up and beat me
Crush me like a kick
A bleeding strap across my back
Some blood that you could kiss
Oh kiss away, oh kiss away
I wish there was a strap of blood
That you could kiss away
I wish there was a strap of blood
That you could kiss away
Tie me with a scarf and jewels
Put a bloody gag to my teeth
I beg you to degrade me
Is there waste that I could eat
I am a secret lover
I am your little girl
Please spit into my mouth
I’m forever in your swirl
You’re heartless and I love that
You have no use of me
But I open the sticks, sticky legs I bear
And then insert a fist, an arm
Some lost appendage
Please open me I beg
You are my goliath
You are my goliath
And I am mistress dread
Oh I am mistress dread
Oh I am mistress dread
Open and release me
I love you in my head
Oh kiss away kiss away
Kiss away kiss away
All I ask my baby
Kiss away
All I ask my baby
Kiss away


You can't put a butterfly in a jar
If the effort's too high no matter who you are
You can't catch the moon, or the sun or the stars
It doesn't matter who you are
Iced honey
Now me I've tried a million tricks
To make life cold and make it stick
Not running heat that flames then out
But the proud piece of ice that always floats
Iced honey
If I can't trap a butterfly or a bee
If I can't keep my heart where I want it to be
If no matter how much soul and heart
I put to the wood
If a flaming heart is not that good
Iced honey
If you can't put a butterfly in a jar
If violence mars your final hour
If you make others feel like jam
Poured on a piece of charbroiled lamb
If it's all mixed up and you cannot shout
And your oxygen starts to run out
If your final gasp has the recipe wrong
And instead of hello you say so long
If your energy starts to leak out
And people wonder what you're all about
A heartbreaker with an unattached heart
The story of love gives them all a start
And me, I've always been this way
Not by choice, just this way
I can't put my honey pot in a jar
Or a heart or a fist of some young boy
If you can't put a butterfly in a jar
No wonder no need to wonder where you are
It might seem like Hell, the river Styx
Your affection never sticks
No matter what you say, no matter what you do
A butterfly heart flies right past you
There's nothing to say, nothing to do
See if the ice will melt for you
Iced honey


Why do you cheat on me
Why do I cheat on thee
Why do I cheat on me
Why do I cheat on me
I have a passionate heart
It can tear us apart
I have the loves of many men
But I don’t love any of them
Why do I cheat on me
You have your feelings
I have mine
I spit upon you and change my mind
I have many hearts to break
And many, many, many more to take
Let the light of stars pour out
Like a candle in a spout
Let the wick recede and break
Let the starlight radiate
Why do you cheat on me
Why do I cheat on me
Why do I cheat on thee
Why do I desecrate me
Why do I piss my dreams
That’s because that’s what it is
I have the drive
I got the scope
If I, if I, if I, could I give you a rope
Your love means zero to me
I’m a passionateless wave upon the sea
Passionateless wave upon the sea
Why, why, why
Do you cheat on me
Why, why, why
Do I cheat on thee
Oh why, do I cheat on me
Why do I cheat on myself
Well I got nobody else
I’m only young once
I want to taste it all and have fun
I have no real feelings in my soul
Where most have passion I got a hole
I really got nobody else
I want lovers like the rain
So many of them, so much the same
You say you love me, I know it’s true
But I, I, I don’t love you
Why do I cheat on me
Why do you cheat on me
Your love means zero to me
A passionateless wave
Your love means zero to me


Frustration
In my lexicon of hate
I see you with your portraiture
Does he love you?
Does he love you too?
The brush strokes
Kiss your breasts and toes
I cry icicles in my stein
The heartbeats flutter
With an abnormal rhythm
The pain shoots through my body
A sword between my thighs
I wish that I could kill you
But I too love your eyes
You’re feeling less whore but you stimulate
The hatred smolders in your eyes
I’d drop to my knees in a second
To salivate in your thighs
But all I do is fall over
I don’t have the strength I once had
In you and your prickless lover
And his easel in his eyes
I feel the pain creep up my leg
Blood runs from my nose
I puke my guts out at your feet
You’re more man than I
To be dead to have no feeling
To be dry and spermless like a girl
I want so much to hurt you
I want so much to hurt you
I want so much to hurt you
Marry me
I want you as my wife
Spermless like a girl
More man than I
More man than I
Frustration
In my lexicon of hate
You’re feeling less like a whore but you
Stimulate
All I do is fall over
I don’t have the strength I once had
All I do is fall over
I don’t have the strength I once had
I want you so much to hurt you
I want so much to hurt you
I want so much to hurt you
I want you as a wife
Frustration is my lexicon of hate
Frustration is my lexicon of hate
Fru… fru… frustration, my lexicon of hate
I cry icicles
Heartbeats flutter
Abnormal rhythm
I wish that I could kill you
But I too love your eyes
I want you as my wife
I want you as my wife
Spermless like a girl
Lucky in feeling
More man than I
Marry me, marry me, marry me
I want you as a wife
Spermless like a girl
Puking my guts at your feet
More man than I
Fru… fru… fru… frustration
Frustration


Little dog who can’t get in
Moaning at the bed side
Moaning from each limb
Little dog who can’t get in
Can only cry but
Can not swim
Pony legs, little trot
Little dog has to wait a lot
The bigger dog has got his spot
And elbowed him away
Listen to him barking
Listen to him call
Little dog don’t have much at all
A puny body and a tiny dick
A little dog can make you sick
If you got the money you can go to the top
The female dog don’t care what you got
As long as you can raise that
Little doggie face to a cold hearted pussy
You could have a taste
A taste of what the big dog got
A taste of what the big dog got
The little dog with the one hundred dollar spot
Can run his tongue over the hot in trot
Hot in trot
Run his tongue over the hot in trot
Money can do anything
Money can do anything
Money can do anything
Tell me what you want
My small dog, he want what I got
Wants to run his tongue over my hot spot
Pathetic little dog
Pathetic little dog
The little man follows his nose
Counts his fingers and his toes
He still got those
Pathetic little dog
Pathetic little dog
Following his nose
But it needs my money to buy
I’m an up while you’re a down
I am an up while you’re a down
The spring and the will follow me around
While you sniff your shit in the wind
Sniff your shit in the wind
Money can do anything
Money can do anything
Tell me what it is you want
Just tell me what it is you want
I’m an up while you’re a down
The spring and the will follow me around
Tell me what it is you want
Tell me what it is you want
You sniff your shit in the wind
Follow me around
Pathetic little dog
Pathetic little dog
Pathetic little dog


You don’t actually care
Love for you is no beginning
You’re not really there
Hallucination
I thought you were listening
Hallucination
I thought you were listening
Hallucination
I understand you think you’re above it
The adolescent sense of the sky
The feeling of billowing heartbeats
The fingertips run through your hair
They run through your hair
Hallucination
Hallucination
Oh you think you’re so special
That there’s no law meant for you
You come and go like the goddess you are
We’re mere mortals below
Fingertips run through your hair
We are mere mortals below
Are meant to be peons
Are meant to be servants
Are meant to be dismissible objects
One fucks with
One fucks with
Poor pitiful creature
The winner in heartbreak
The winner in caring
The winner in every miniscule method of wearing
Your heart on your sleeve
A red star of idiocy
An idiot’s idiocy
My, my caring for you
Caring for you
Do you think we’re a book
Some kind of a table
You can rest your feet on when you’re able
Red star of idiocy
An idiot’s idiocy
My caring for you
Poor pitiful creature
To notice the pining
The self deprivation
The self flagellation of you
Dear worshippers
We do like you regal
We do like you haughty
We do love to look upon your perfect body
The hair on your shoulders
The smell of your armpit
The taste of your vulva and everything on it
We all really love you
And you have no meaning
You don’t even see us
You were never caring
You go do what you do
You do it for you
No one exists with you
You’re way above caring
Leave a trail upon the wake
That no one ever tries to take
Because waiting for you
Thinking of you
Is another way of dying
Is another way of dying
I’m clawing your chest
‘Til your collarbone bleeds
Piercing your nipples ’til I bite them off
I scratch your face and bite your shoulders
Way above caring
Way above caring
And your Kotex jukebox
Your Kotex jukebox
I’m doomed, I’m swearing
Waiting for you
In your high heels and nightie
Your leather dress squeaking
Latex now sweating, waiting for you
In your tincture
Your opium white bathrobe
Your white tiles run red now
Are we both dead now?
The liquid exchange of our heart
The liquid exchange of our heart
Are we both dead now?
You’re way above caring
Your heart on your sleeve
A red star of idiocy
An idiot’s idiocy
My caring
My caring for you
My caring for you
You’re way beyond caring
Your heart on your sleeve
A red star of idiocy
An idiot’s idiocy
My caring for you
Oblivious to caring
Oblivious to caring
Oblivious to caring
Leave a trail upon the wake
That no one ever tries to take
Because waiting for you
Because thinking of you
Is another way of dying
You’re way above caring
Oblivious to caring
Oblivious to caring
You poor pitiful creature
The mistake of feeling
The one who rejects you is the winner,
It’s true
The winner in heartbreak
The winner in caring
The winner in every miniscule method of wearing
Your heart on your sleeve
A red star of idiocy
An idiot’s idiocy
Your heart on your fuckin’ sleeve
My caring for you
We were meant to be peons
We’re meant to be peons
Mere mortals below
Meant to be servants
Meant to be dismissible objects one fucks with
Oh, oh, oh you’re so special
No law meant for you
You come and go like the goddess you are
The fingertips run through your hair
A billowing heart beats
Feeling
Feeling
What a glorious feeling
To be so rejected
So rejected
An idiot’s idiocy
My caring for you
You think I’m a book or a table
You can rest your fuckin’ feet on
When you’re able
The taste of your vulva, everything on it
The hair on your shoulders
The smell of your armpit
We do love you, to look upon your perfect body
We love you regal
We love you haughty
Oblivious to caring
Oblivious to caring
Caring
Oh my dear
Oh my dear
Oh my dear
Oblivious to caring
Are we really dead now?
Are we both dead now?


Would you come to me
If I was half drowning
An arm above the last wave
Would you come to me
Would you pull me up
Would the effort really hurt you
Is it unfair to ask you
To help pull me up
The window broke the silence of the matches
The smoke effortlessly floating
Pull me up
Would you be my lord and savior
Pull me up by my hair
Now would you kiss me, on my lips
Burning fever burning on my forehead
The brain that once was listening now
Shoots out its tiresome message
Won’t you pull me up
Scalding, my dead father
Has the motor and he’s driving towards
An island of lost souls
Sunny, a monkey then to monkey
I will teach you meanness, fear and blindness
No social redeeming kindness
Or – oh, state of grace
Would you pull me up
Would you drop the mental bullet
Would you pull me by the arm up
Would you still kiss my lips
Hiccup, the dream is over
Get the coffee, turn the lights on
Say hello to junior dad
The greatest disappointment
Age withered him and changed him
Into junior dad
Psychic savagery
The greatest disappointment
The greatest disappointment
Age withered him and changed him
Into junior dad


Hate is a train
That thunders aimless through my head
And hate is the fame
Chained to the wheel until I am dead
Rage is a flame
Creates a touch to boil the seas
And rage is to blame
Forever sorry I shall be
And from a darkness I descend
Clenching a torch of sweet revenge
No
You took away tomorrow, still I stand
I ride into the sorrow, still I stand
You took away tomorrow, still I stand
Straight down into the sorrow, but still I stand
Wrath is the name
Branding suffer onto you
And wrath takes the shame 
And holds me down until it is through
And from a darkness I descend
Clenching a torch of sweet revenge
You took away tomorrow, still I stand
I ride into the sorrow, still I stand
You took away tomorrow, still I stand
I sink into the sorrow, still I stand
And hate is a train
That hungers for the flesh's call
And hate takes the blame
A beast that never slows at all
And from a darkness I descend
Clenching a torch of sweet revenge
Burst into flame, the bitter end
And shake the gates of hell again
Yeah, cursed to drown in sorrow
You took away tomorrow, still I stand
I ride into the sorrow, still I stand
You took away tomorrow, still I stand
You left me here with sorrow, still I stand
Oh, still I stand


All roads they lead to shame
All drowning in the blame
All reflections look the same
In the shine of the midnight revolver
All hide beneath a skin
A hope so paper thin
I'm at the door again
And the shine of the midnight revolver
Even the promise of danger has gone dull
Staring down the barrel of a 45
Suck on the barrel
Suck on the barrel
Suck it 'til it's gone dry
For all reflections look the same
In the shine of the midnight revolver
Redemption purify
Will nothing satisfy
The scars just multiply
In the shine of the midnight revolver
Twisting in apocalypse
Death upon the fingertips
Frigid metal touches lips
And the shine of the midnight revolver
'Cause you lied
Just a bullet away
Just a bullet away from leavin' you
Just a bullet away
Stop the voices in my head
Caressing death again
Becomes the heroin
Forbidden medicine
Puts a shine on the midnight revolver
Eternal borderline
All the faces intertwine
Oh God... now I see mine
In the shine of the midnight revolver
Even the promise of danger has gone dull
Staring down the barrel of a 45
Suck on the barrel
Suck on the barrel
Suck... suck till it's dry
For all reflections look the same
In the shine of the midnight revolver
Down In Misery
Down In Misery
Just a bullet away
Just a bullet away from leavin' you
Just a bullet away
Stop the voices in my head
All roads they lead to shame
All drowning in the blame
Reflections look the same
In the shine of the midnight revolver
All hide beneath a skin
A hope so paper thin
I'm at the door again
And the shine of the midnight revolver
Even the promise of danger has gone dull
Staring down the barrel of a 45
Suck on the barrel
Suck on the barrel
Suck... suck till it's dry
Do all reflections look the same
In the shine of the midnight revolver
'Cause you lied
Yes you lied
Just a bullet away
Just a bullet away from leavin' you
Just a bullet away
Stop the voices in my head


There is nowhere else I can run to 
She is wretched but she comforts me
After everyone goes home
She's always there for me
And when the sun goes hellbound
And the moon does resurrect the night
I'll hide within her
Not much good has come out the light
After everyone goes home
And I'm left here on my own
I will run straight to Hell and back
Straight to Hell and back
When they turn out all their lights
And I'm left to brood at night
Always return to Hell and back
Straight to Hell and back
Straight down
A lonely light in a window
Just longing for some company
Tragic, heartless and hateful
But there's nothing as willing as she
And when the night has fallen
It falls hard and then it all begins
When she starts her calling
I feel my darkness growing from within
I become two
We become one
Unbridled... unequaled... unholy... undone
The path is cut deep
The path is worn well
I'll follow my footsteps to the warmth of Hell
The warmth of Hell


Rebel grip your bottle tight
Just float away
Rebel is it hard to leave
What makes you stay?
Go take your poison ink
Sign life away
Then take your dirty spoon
And dig your grave
Rebel grips the bottle tight
Just floats away
Rebel finds it hard to leave
What makes you stay?
He takes the poison ink
Signing life away
Then takes the dirty spoon
And digs his grave
Let this dark shine
Let this dark shine
Let it shine bright
Don't let it burn out tonight
Kill me one more time
Stigmata
Kill me one more time
Neo martyr
Gonna die young
Gonna live forever
Kill me one more time
Rise up
Rebel of Babylon
Rise up
Rise up
Resurrection
Renegade fights the fight
That no one wins
He claims a crown of thorns
To pierce the skin
He climbs his crucifix
And waits for dawn
Thinks they'll remember him
After he's gone
The rebel fights the fight
That no one wins
To claim a crown of thorns
To pierce his skin
Climbs his crucifix
And waits for dawn
He loses consciousness
The myth lives on


Don't you leave me Father Time
Take me with you
Tell me does your sun still shine
Come squeeze the world and drip it down my throat...oh yeah
Down my throat again....woooah
You got to breathe man, breathe!
Coming up for Air
Breathe man, breathe!
Coming up for Air
Touch me so I think I'm here
Skin my senses
Barely breathing
Minus Human
Please squeeze the world and drip it down my throat again
Down my throat again.....woooah
You got to breathe man, breathe!
Coming up for Air
Breathe man, breathe!
Coming up for Air
You got to breathe man, breathe!
Coming up for Air
Breathe man, breathe!
Coming up for!

Sight
Pale riders into the night
Galloping harder and faster
Through your dreaming wake
Walk through the fire innate
Frost bitten soul below zero
Excitation
Are you remembering the sound
Recall the shaking of the ground
Calling, calling
All as one
Lords of summer bring the sun
Coming, coming
Winter's yearn
Lords of summer shall return
Eternal thawing has begun
Come trade your darkness for the sun
Melting the chill of winter's turn
For soon the lords of summer shall return
Lords of summer shall return
Straight
Life passes through penetrate
It's been a long lonely winter
Illumination
Bright
Fading the volume and light
Reanimated by fire
Transformation
Become the nexus of the sound
Become the shaking of the ground
Calling, calling
All as one
Lords of summer bring the sun
Coming, coming
Winter's yearn
Lords of summer have returned
Eternal thawing has begun
Come trade your darkness for the sun
Melting the chill of winter's turn
Now that the lords of summer have returned
Lords of summer have returned
Calling, calling

Lords of summer bring the sun
Coming, coming

Lords of summer have returned, have returned
Eternal thawing has begun
Come trade your darkness for the sun
Melting the chill of winter's turn
Now that the lords of summer have returned
Lords of summer have returned


And it feels right this time
On this crash course with the big time
Pay no mind to the distant thunder
New day fills his head with wonder, boy....
Says it feels right this time
Turned it 'round and found the right line
Good day to be alive Sir
Good day to be alive, he said.....
Then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel
Is just a freight train coming your way
Then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel

All the pieces fall to his wish
Sucker for that quick reward boy
Sucker for that quick reward they said.....
Then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel
Is just a freight train coming your way

[A Light In The Black intro][Tarot Woman]
I don't wanna go
Something tells me no, no, no, no
But traces in the sand
The lines inside my hand say go go go
Beware of a place
A smile on a bright shiny face
I'll never return, how do you know
Tarot woman, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
She can take you there
The entrance to the fair, my, my, my
Ride the carousel
Cast a magic spell, you can fly, fly, fly
Beware of a place
A smile on a bright shiny face
I'll never return, how do you know
Tarot woman, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know[Stargazer]
High noon
Oh I'd sell my soul for water
Nine years' worth
Of breakin' my back
There's no sun in the shadow of the wizard
See how he glides
Why he's lighter than air
Oh I see his face
Where is your star
Is it far, is it far, is it far
When do we leave
I believe, I believe, yes, I believe
In the heat and the rain
With whips and chains
Just to see him fly
So many die
We built a tower of stone
With our flesh and bone
Just to see him fly
Don't know why
Now where do we go...[Kill The King]
Danger, danger the Queen's about to kill
There's a stranger, stranger and life about to spill
Oh no move away from harm
I need a spell and a charm
Fly like the wind
I'm no pawn, so be gone, speed on and on
Kill the king
Tear him down
Kill the king, yeah

Power, power happens every day
Power, devour all along the way
Oh no, move away from harm

And fly like the wind

Kill the king
Strike him down
Treason, treason, the spectre looms again
Treason, reason, the realm is safe and then
Oh no, move away from harm
I need a spell and a charm
Fly like the rainbow
I'm no pawn, so be gone, speed on and on
Kill the king, yeah
Tear him down
Kill the king, yeah
Got to take his crown


Imagine you were at my station
And you brought your motor to me
Your a burner yeah a real motor car
Said you wanna get your order filled

Pumping just won't do ya know luckily for you
Who ever thought you'd be better
At turning a screw than me

Made my pistons buldge
Made my ball bearings melt from the heat
We were shifting hard when we took off
Put tonight all four on the floor
When we hit top end ya know it feels too slow
I'm giving you my room service
And ya know it's more than enough
Oh one more time ya know I'm in love
