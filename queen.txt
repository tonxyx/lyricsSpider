I was told a million times
Of all the troubles in my way
How I had to keep on trying
Little better ev'ry day
But if I crossed a million rivers
And I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started
Bread and butter for a smile
Well I sold a million mirrors
In a shop in Alley Way
But I never saw my face
In any window any day
Well they say your folks are telling you
To be a super star
But I tell you just be satisfied
To stay right where you are
Keep yourself alive keep yourself alive
It'll take you all your time and a money
Honey you'll survive
Well I've loved a million women
In a belladonic haze
And I ate a million dinners
Brought to me on silver trays
Give me ev'rything I need
To feed my body and my soul
And I'll grow a little bigger
Maybe that can be my goal
I was told a million times
Of all the people in my way
How I had to keep on trying
And get better ev'ry day
But if I crossed a million rivers
And I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started
Still be where I started
Keep yourself alive keep yourself alive
It'll take you all your time and money honey
You'll survive
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
It'll take you all your time and money
To keep me satisfied
Do you think you're better ev'ry day
No I just think I'm two steps nearer to my grave
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive mm
You take your time and take your money
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
All you people keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
It'll take you all your time and a money
To keep me satisfied
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
All you people keep yourself alive
Take you all your time and money honey
You will survive
Keep you satisfied
Keep you satisfied


Yesterday my life was in ruins
Now today I know what I'm doing
Got a feeling I should be doing all right
Doing all right
Where will I be this time tomorrow?
Chasing joy or drinking in sorrow
Anyway I should be doing all right
Doing all right
Simply waiting for the sign
Waiting here to find the words to say
Sitting waiting all this time here
All the time you're away
Sitting waiting for the sign
And anyway I got so far
Yesterday my life was in ruins
Now today I've learned what I'm doing
Anyway I should be doing all right
Doing all right


Great King Rat died today
Born on the twenty first of May
Died syphillis forty four on his birthday
Every second word he swore
Yes he was the son of a whore
Always wanted by the law
Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know people?
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
Now what did I tell you
Would you like to see?
Where will I be tomorrow?
Will I beg or will I borrow?
I don't care I don't care anyway
Come on come on the time is right
I told you ah yes I told you
And that's no lie oh no no no
Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
Now what did I tell you?
Would you like to see?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know people?
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
Now what did I tell you?
Would you like to see?
Now listen all you people
Put out the good and keep the bad
Don't believe all you read in the Bible
You sinners get in line
Saints you leave far behind
Very soon you're gonna be h
Don't listen to what mama says
Not a word not a word mama says
Or else you'll find yourself being the rival
The great Lord before He died
Knelt sinners by his side
And said you're gonna realize tomorrow
No I'm not gonna tell you
What you already know
'Cause time and time again
The old man said it all a long time ago
Come come on the time is right
This evil man will fight
I told you once before
Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Just like I said before
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
The last time I tell you?
Would you like to see?


In the land where horses born with eagle wings
And honey bees have lost their stings
There's singing forever
Lion's den with fallow deer
And rivers made from wine so clear
Flow on and on forever
Dragons fly like sparrows thru' the air
And baby lambs where Samson dares
To go on on on on on on[First voice] [Second Voice]
My fairy king can see things | He rules the air and turns the tides
That are not there for you and me | Ohh yeah he guides the winds
My fairy king can do right and nothing wrong
Then came man to savage in the night
To run like thieves and to kill like knives
To take away the power from the magic hand
To bring about the ruin to the promised land
They turn the milk into sour
Like the blue in the blood of my veins
Why can't you see it
Fire burnin' in hell with the cry of screaming pain
Son of heaven set me free and let me go
Sea turn dry no salt from sand
Teeth don't shine like pearls for the poor man's eyes
Someone someone has drained the colour from my wings
Broken my fairy circle ring
And shamed the king in all his pride
Changed the winds and wronged the tides
Mother mercury (mercury)
Look what they've done to me
I cannot run I cannot hide


I have sinned dear Father Father I have sinned
Try and help me Father
Won't you let me in? Liar

Raised my voice in anger

Liar oh ev'rybody deceives me
Liar why don't you leave me alone?

Liar from Mars to Mercury
Liar I have drunk the wine
Liar time after time

When I was young it came to me
And I could see the sun breakin'
Lucy was high and so was I dazzling
Holding the world inside
Once I believed in everyone
Everyone and anyone can see
Oh oh the night comes down
And I get afraid of losing my way
Oh oh the night comes down
Oooh and it's dark again
Once I could laugh with everyone
Once I could see the good to me
Holding the world inside
Now all the world is grey to me
Nobody can see you gotta believe it
Oh oh the night comes down
And I get afraid of losing my way
Oh oh the night comes down
Oooh and it's dark again
And it's dark again
And it's dark again


Had to make do with a worn out rock and roll scene
The old bop is gettin' tired need a rest
Well you know what I mean
Fifty eight that was great
But it's over now and That's all
Somethin' harder's coming up
Gonna really knock a hole in the wall
Gonna hit ya grab you hard
Make you feel ten feet tall
Well I hope this baby's gonna come along soon
You don't know it could happen any ol' rainy afternoon
With the temperature down
And the juke box blowin' no fuse
And my musical life's feelin
Like a long Sunday School cruise
And you know there's one thing
Every single body could use
Yeah listen to me baby
Let me tell you what it's all about
Modern times rock and roll
Modern times rock and roll
Get you high heeled guitar boots and some groovy clothes
Get a hair piece on your chest
And a ring through your nose
Find a nice little man who says
He's gonna make you a real big star
Stars in your eyes and ants in your pants
Think you should go far
Everybody in this bum sucking world
Gonna know just who you are
Look out
Modern times rock and roll


Tried to be your son and daughter rolled into one
You said you'd equal any man for having your fun
Now didn't you feel surprise to find
The cap just didn't fit?
The world expects a man
To buckle down and to shovel shit
What'll you do for loving
When its only just begun?
I want you to be a woman
Tried to be a teacher and a fisher of men
An equal
Will you lead us all the same?
Well I travelled around the world
To find a brand new word for day
Watching the time mustn't linger behind
Pardon me I have to get away
What'll you think of heaven
If it's back from where you came?
I want you to be a woman


And then I saw Him in the crowd
A lot of people had gathered round Him
The beggers shouted and the lepers called Him
The old man said nothing
He just stared about Him
All going down to see the Lord Jesus
All going down to see the Lord Jesus
All going down
Then came a man before His feet he fell
Unclean said the leper and rang his bell
Felt the palm of a hand touch his head
Go now go now you're a new man instead
All going down to see the Lord Jesus
All going down to see the Lord Jesus
All going down
It all began with the three wise men
Followed a star took them to Bethelehem
And made it heard throughout the land
Born was the leader of man
All going down to see the Lord Jesus
All going down to see the Lord Jesus
All going down
It all began with the three wise men
Followed a star took them to Bethelehem
And made it heard throughout the land
Born was the leader of man
All going down to see the Lord Jesus
All going down to see the Lord Jesus
All going down


Fear me you lords and lady preachers
I descend upon your earth from the skies
I command your very souls you unbelievers
Bring before me what is mine
The seven seas of rhye
Can you hear me you peers and privvy counsellors
I stand before you naked to the eyes
I will destroy any man who dares abuse my trust
I swear that you'll be mine
The seven seas of rhye
Sister - I live and lie for you
Mister - do and I'll die
You are mine I possess you
I belong to you forever
Storm the master-marathon I'll fly through
By flash and thunder-fire I'll survive
Then I'll defy the laws of nature and come out alive
Then I'll get you
Be gone with you - you shod and shady senators
Give out the good, leave out the bad evil cries
I challenge the mighty titan and his troubadours
And with a smile
I'll take you to the seven seas of rhye


I've been there before
A long time ago
But this time I wear no sandals
Ages past I gave all you people
Food and water
Three feet tall, so very small
I'm no trouble
I bring thunder and lightning
Sun and the rain
For all the people in the land
A message of love
I bring you from up above
All you children gather around
Come join your hands and sing along
They call me mad the swine
I guess I'm mad the swine
I've come to save you
Save you
Mad the swine
Mad the swine
So all you people gather around
Hold out your hands and praise the lord
I walk upon the water
Just as before
I help the meek and the mild
The believers and the blind
And all the creatures great and small
Let me take you to the river
Without a fall
Then one day you'll realize
You're all the same within his eyes
That's all I've got to say
Just like before
They call me mad the swine
Mad the swine
Come to save you
Save you
Mad the swine
Mad the swine
So all you people gather around
Hold out your hands and praise the lord
So all you people gather around
Hold out your hands and praise the lord
Don't ever fail me
Mad the swine
Mad the swine
Come to save you
Save you
Mad the swine
Mad the swine
So all you people gather around
Hold out your hands and praise the lord
Hands and praise the lord


A word in your ear, from father to son
hear the words that I say
I fought with you, fought on your side
Long before you were born
Joyful the sound, the word goes around
From father to son, to son
And the voice is so clear, time after time it leeps
Calling you, calling you on
Don't destroy what you see, your country to be
Just keep on building on the ground that's been won
Kings will be crowned, the word goes around
From father to son, to son
Take this letter that I give you,
Take it sonny, hold it high
You won't understand a word that's in it
But you'll write it all again before you die
A word in your ear from father to son
Funny you don't hear a single word I say
But my letter to you, will stay by your side
Through the years till the loneliness is gone
Sing if you will -
But the air you breathe I live to give you
Father to son
Father to, father to, father to son
Joyful the sound, the word goes around
From father to son, to son...
Kings will be crowned, the word goes around
From father to son, to son...


So sad her eyes
Smiling dark eyes
So sad her eyes
As it began
On such a breathless night as this
Upon my brow the lightest kiss
I walked alone
And all around the air did say
My lady soon will stir this way
In sorrow known
The white queen walks and
The night grows pale
Stars of lovingmess in her hair
Needing - unheard
Pleading - one word
So sad my eyes
She cannot see
How did thee fare, what have thee seen
The mother of the willow green
I call her name
And 'neath her window have i stayed
I loved the footsteps that she made
And when she came
White queen how my heart did ache
And dry my lips no word would make
So still i wait
My goddess hear my darkest fear
I speak too late
It's for evermore that i wait
Dear friend goodbye
No tear in my eyes
So sad it ends
As it began


You never heard my song before the music was too loud
But now i think you hear me well for now we both know how
No star can light our way in this cloud of dark and fear
But some day, one day...
Funny how the pages turn and hold us in between
A misty castle waits for you and you shall be a queen
Today the cloud it hangs over us and all is grey
But some day, one day...
When i was you and you were me and we were very young
Together took us nearly there the rest may not be sung
So still the cloud it hangs over us and we're alone
But some day, one day...
We'll come home


Mama's gotta problem
She don't know what to say
Her little baby boy just left home today
She's got to be the loser in the end
She's got to be the loser in the end
Misuse her and you'll lose her as a friend
She's ma on whom you can always depend
She washed and fed, and clothed and cared
For nearly twenty years
And all she gets is "goodbye ma"
And the nightimes for her tears
She's got to be the loser in the end
She's got to be the loser in the end
Misuse her and you'll lose her as a friend
She's ma on whom you can always depend
So listen mothers everywhere
To just one mother's son
You'll get forgotten on the way
If you don't let them have their fun
Forget regrets, and just remember
It's so long since you were young
You're bound to be the loser in the end
You're bound to be the loser in the end
They'll choose their new shoes that's not far to bend
You're ma on whom they can always depend


Now once upon a time - an old man told me a fable
When the piper is gone - and the soup is cold on your table
And if the black crow flies to find a new destination - that is the sign
Come tonight
Come to the ogre sight
Come to the ogre-battle-fight
He gives a great big cry and he can swallow up the ocean
With a mighty tongue he catches flies - the palm of his hand is incredible
One great big eye - has a focus in your direction
Now the battle is on
Yeah yeah yeah
Come tonight
Come to the ogre sight
Come to the ogre-battle-fight
The ogre men are still inside
The two-way mirror mountain
Gotta keep down right out of sight
You can't see in but they can see out
"Keep a look out"
The ogre-men are coming out
From the two-way mirror mountain
They're running up behind you and they're coming all about
Can't go east 'cos you gotta go south
Ogre-men are going home
And the great big fight is over
Bugle blow, the trumpet cry
Ogre battle lives for ever more
You can come along
You can come along
Come to ogre battle


He's a fairy feller
The fairy folk have gathered round the new moon shine
To see the feller crack a nut at nights noon time
To swing his ace he swears, as it climbs he dares
To deliver...
The master-stroke
Ploughman, "waggoner will", and types
Politician with senatorial pope - he's a dilly-dally-o
Pedagogue squinting, wears a frown
And a satyr peers under lady's gown, dirty fellow
What a dirty laddio
Tatterdemalion and a junketer
There's a thief and a dragonfly trumpeter - he's my hero
Fairy dandy tickling the fancy of his lady friend
The nymph in yellow "can we see the master-stroke"
What a quaere fellow
Soldier, sailor, tinker, tailor, ploughboy
Waiting to hear the sound
And the arch-magician presides
He is the leader
Oberon and titania watched by a harridan
Mab is the queen and there's a good apothecary-man
Come to say hello
Fairy dandy tickling the fancy of his lady friend
The nymph in yellow
What a quaere fellow
The ostler stares with hands on his knees
Come on mr. feller, crack it open if you please


There's no living in my life anymore
The seas have gone dry and the rain stopped falling
Please don't you cry anymore
Can't you see
Listen to the breeze, whisper to me please
Don't send me to the path of nevermore
Even the valleys below
Where the rays of the sun were so warn and tender
Now haven't anything to grow
Can't you see
Why did you have to leave me
Why did you deceive me
You send me to the path of nevermore
When you say you didn't love me anymore
Nevermore
Nevermore


Do you mean it?
Do you mean it?
Do you mean it?
Why don't you mean it?
Why do I follow you and where do you go?
You've never seen nothing like it no never in your life
Like going up to heaven and then coming back alive
Let me tell you all about it—
And the world will so allow it
Ooh, give me a little time to choose
Water babies singing in a lily-pool delight
Blue powder monkies praying in the dead of night
Here comes the Black Queen, poking in the pile
Fie-Fo the Black Queen, marching single file
Take this, take that, bring them down to size
Put them in the cellar with the naughty boys
A little nigger sugar then a rub-a dub-a baby oil
Black on, black on every finger nail and toe
We've only begun, begun
Make this, make that, keep making all that noise
Now I've got a belly-full
You can be my sugar-baby, you can be my honey-chile, yes
A voice from behind me reminds me
Spread out your wings, you are an angel
Remember to deliver with the speed of light
A little bit of love and joy
Everything you do bears a will and a why and a wherefore
A little bit of love and joy
In each and every soul lies a man
And very soon he'll deceive and discover
But even till the end of his life, he'll bring a little love
I reign with my left hand, I rule with my right
I'm lord of all darkness, I'm Queen of the night
I've got the power—
Now do the march of the black queen
My life is in your hands, I'll fo and I'll fie
I'll be what you make me, I'll do what you like
I'll be your bad boy - I'll be your bad boy
I'll do the march of the Black Queen
Walking true to style
She's vulgar 'buse and vile
Fie-Fo the Black Queen tattoos all her pies
She boils, and she bakes, and she never dots her Is
Forget your sing-alongs and your lullabies
Surrender to the city of the fireflies
Dance with the devil in beat with the band
To hell with all of you hand-in-hand
But now it's time to be gone forever


Funny how love is everywhere just look and see
Funny how love is anywhere you're bound to be
Funny how love is every song in every key
Funny how love is coming home in time for tea
Funny, funny, funny
Funny how love is the end of lies when the truth begins
Tomorrow comes tomorrow beings
Tomorrow brings love in the shape of things
That's what love is, that's what love is
Funny how love is can break your heart so suddenly
Funny how love came tumbling down with adam and eve
Funny how love is running wild and feeling free
Funny how live is coming home in time for tea
Funny, funny, funny
From the earth below to the heavens above
That's how far and funny is love
At any time, anywhere
If you gotta make love do it everywhere
That's what love is, that's what love is
Funny how love is everywhere just look and see
Funny how love is anywhere you're bound to be
Funny how love is every song and every key
Funny how love is when you gotta hurry home
'Cos you're late for tea
Funny, funny, funny how love is
Tomorrow comes, tomorrow brings
Tomorrow brings love in the shape of things
At any time, anywhere
If you gotta make love do it everywhere
That's what love is, that's what love is

Well she's gone gone this morning
See what a fool I've been
For so long
See what a fool I've been
Didn't leave no letter didn't leave no warning
I guess I'm all to blame oh lord
Guess I'm all to blame
My little dog ain't too hungry he kept on barking
Said it just it just don't seem the same
Well i got so lonely
Went and told my neighbor
She said mm mm mm mm mm
Oh lord what a fool I've been
And she told what to do
Well she's gone gone this morning
See what a fool I've been
For so long
See what a fool I've been


Happy little day, Jimmy went away
Met his little Jenny on a public holiday
A happy pair they made, so decorously laid
'Neath the gay illuminations all along the promenade
"It's so good to know there's still a little magic in the air
I'll weave my spell"
"Jenny will you stay - tarry with me pray
Nothing 'ere need come between us tell me love, what
do you say"
"Oh no I must away to my Mum in disarray
If my mother should discover how I spent my holiday
It would be of small avail to talk of magic in the air
I'll say farewell"
O Rock of Ages, do not crumble, love is breathing still
O Lady Moon, shine down a little people magic if you will
Jenny pines away, writes a letter everyday
"We must ever be together, nothing can my love erase"
"Oh no I'm compromised, I must apologize
If my lady should discover how I spent my holidays..."

My new purple shoes, bin' amazin' the people next door
And my rock 'n roll 45's, bin' enragin' the folks on the lower floor
I got a way with girls on my block
Try my best be a real individual
And when we go down to Smokies and rock
They line up like it's some kinda ritual
Oh give me a good guitar, and you can say that my hair's a disgrace
Or, just give me an open car, I'll make the speed of light outta this place
I like the good things in life
But most of the best things ain't free
And this same situation, just cuts like a knife
When you're young, and you're poor, and you're crazy
But oh, give me a good guitar, and you can say that my hair's a disgrace
Or, just give me an open car, I'll make the speed of light outta this place


Dislocate your spine if you don't sign he says
I'll have you seeing double
Mesmerize you when he's tongue-tied
Simply with those eyes
Synchronize your minds and see
The beast within him rise
Don't look back
Don't look back
It's a rip-off
Flick of the wrist and you're dead baby
Blow him a kiss and you're mad
Flick of the wrist - he'll eat your heart out
A dig in the ribs and then a kick in the head
He's taken an arm and taken a leg
All this time honey
Baby you've been had.
Intoxicate your brain with what I'm saying
If not you'll lie in knee-deep trouble
Prostitute yourself he says
Castrate your human pride
Sacrifice your leisure days
Let me squeeze you till you've dried
Don't look back
Don't look back
It's a rip-off
Work my fingers to my bones
I scream with pain
I still make no impression
Seduce you with his money-make machine
Cross-collateralize, (big-time money, money)
Reduce you to a muzak-fake machine
Then the last goodbye
It's a rip-off
Flick of the wrist and you're dead baby
Blow him a kiss and you're mad
Flick of the wrist - he'll eat your heart out
A dig in the ribs and then a kick in the head
He's taken an arm, and taken a leg
All this time honey
Baby you've been had


I am forever searching high and low
But why does everybody tell me no
Neptune of the seas
Have you an answer for me please
And the lily of the valley doesn't know
I lie in wait with open eyes
I carry on through stormy skies
I follow every course
My kingdom for a horse
But each time I grow old
Serpent of the Nile
Relieve me for a while
And cast me from your spell and let me go
Messenger from Seven Seas has flown
To tell the King of Rhye he's lost his throne
Wars will never cease
Is there time enough for peace
But the lily of the valley doesn't know


Here I stand
Look around around around
But you won't see me
Now I'm here, Now I'm there, I'm just a...
Just a new man
Yes you made me live again
A baby I was when you took my hand
And the light of the night burned bright
And the people all stared didn't understand
But you knew my name on sight
Whatever came of you and me
America's new bride to be - don't worry baby I'm safe and sound
Down in the dungeon just Peaches 'n' me
Don't I love her so
A thin moon me in a smoke-screen sky
Where the beams of your lovelight chase
Don't move, don't speak, don't feel no pain
With a rain running down my face
Your matches still light up the sky
And many a tear lives on in my eye
Down in the city just Hoople 'n' me
Don't I love him so
Whatever comes of you and me
I love to leave my memory with you
Now I'm here
Think I'll stay around around around
We'll be down in the city justa you 'n' me
Don't I love you so


I live my life for you
Think all my thoughts with you,
Anything you ask I do, for you
and only you
I touch your lips with mine
But in the end
I leave it to the lords
Leave it in the lap of the Gods
What more can I do
Leave it in the lap of the Gods
I leave it to you
Leave it in the lap of the Gods
Leave it in the lap of the Gods
I want you to
Leave it in the lap of the Gods
Lap of the Gods


Sleeping very soundly on a Saturday morning I was dreaming
I was Al Capone
There's a rumour going round, gotta clear outta town
I'm smelling like a dry fish bone
Here come the Law, gonna break down the door, gonna carry me
away once more
Never, never, never get it any more
Gotta get away from this stone cold floor
Crazy
Stone cold crazy, you know
Rainy afternoon I gotta blow a typhoon and I'm playing on
my slide trombone
Anymore, anymore, cannot take it anymore
Gotta get away from this stone cold floor
Crazy
Stone cold crazy, you know
Walking down the street, shooting people that I meet with
my rubber tommy water gun
Here come the deputy, he's gonna come and getta me
I gotta get me get up and run
They got the sirens loose
I ran outta juice
They're gonna put me in a cell, if I can't go to heaven
Will they let me go to hell
Crazy
Stone cold crazy, you know


So dear friends your love has gone
Only tears to dwell upon
I dare not say as the wind must blow
So a love is lost, a love is won
Go to sleep and dream again
Soon your hopes will rise and then
From all this gloom life can start anew
And there'll be no crying soon


Don't you misfire
Fill me up
With the desire
To carry on
Don't you know honey, that love's a game
It's always hit or miss, so take your aim
Got to hold on tight, shoot me out of sight
Don't you misfire...
Don't you misfire...
Your gun is loaded, and pointing my way
There's only one bullet, so don't delay
Got to time it right, fire me through the night
Come on, take a shot
Fire me higher
Don't you miss this time
Please don't misfire, misfire


Bring back, bring back
Bring back that Leroy Brown - yeah
Bring back, bring back
Gotta bring that Leroy Brown - back


Daddy Cool with a ninety dollar smile
Took my money out of gratitude
And he git right outta town - well
I gotta getty up, steady up, shoot him down
Gotta hit that latitude - babe
Daddy Cool with a ninety dollar smile
Took my money out of gratitude
And he git right outta town - well
Big bad Leroy Brown he got no common
sense - no, no
He got no brains but he sure gotta lot of style
Can't stand no more in this here jail
I gotta rid myself of this sentence
Gotta get out the heat, step into the shade
Gotta get me there dead or alive - babe
Wooh, wooh, big bad Leroy, wooh, wooh,
Wooh, wooh, big bad Leroy - Brown - well
Daddy Cool with a ninety dollar smile
Took my money out of gratitude
And he git right outta town - well
Big Mama Lulu Belle she had a nervous breakdown
(She had a nervous breakdown)
Leroy's taken her honey chile away
But she met him down at the station
Put a shot gun to his head
And unless I be mistaken
This is what she said
"Big bad, big boy, big bad Leroy Brown
I'm gonna get that cutie pie"
Daddy Cool with a ninety dollar smile
Took my money out of gratitude
And he git right outta town - well


I love
She makes me
She is my heart
She is my love
I know
I'm jealous of her
She makes me need
She is my love
Who knows who she'll make me
As I lie in her cocoon
And the world will surely heal my ills
I'm warm and terrified
She makes me so
I know the day I leave her
I'll love her still
She is my love
She is my love
She knows where my dreams will end
I'll follow as they grow
But the world will know how long I'll take
And if I'm very slow she makes me so
She is my love


Gone and got himself elected president
(We want Leroy for President)
Next time, you gotta hit a bitty baddy
weather
This time, like a shimmy, shammy leather
He's a big boy, bad boy, Leroy
I don't care where you get him from
Bring that big bad Leroy back
Want him back


It's so easy, but I can't do it
So risky - But I gotta chance it
It's so funny, there's nothing to laugh about
My money, that's all you wanna talk about
I can see what you want me to be
But I'm no fool
It's in the lap of the Gods
I can see what you want me to be
But I'm no fool
No beginning, there's no ending
There's no meaning in my pretending
Believe me, life goes on and on and on
Forgive me when I ask you where do I belong
You say I can't set you free from me
But that's not true
It's in the lap of the Gods
I can see what you want me to be
But I'm no fool
It's in the lap of the Gods
Wo wo la la la wo
Wo wo la la
Wah wah ooh
But that's not true


You suck my blood like a leech
You break the law and you preach
Screw my brain till it hurts
You've taken all my money and you want more,
Misguided old mule
With your pigheaded rules
With your narrow-minded cronies who are fools of the first division-
Death on two legs
You're tearing me apart,
Death on two legs
You never had a heart of your own
Kill joy, Bad guy,
Big talking, Small fry
You're just an old barrow - boy
Have you found a new toy to replace me,
Can you face me
But now you can kiss my ass goodbye
Feel good, are you satisfied
Do you feel like suicide (I think you should)
Is your conscience all right
Does it plague you at night,
Do you feel good, feel good?
Talk like a big business tycoon,
You're just a hot air balloon,
So no one gives you a damn,
You're just an overgrown school boy
Let me tan your hide.
Dog with disease,
You're the king of the 'sleaze'
Put your money where your mouth is Mr. Know all,
Was the fin on your back part of the deal...(shark!)
Death on two legs
Tearing me apart
Death on two legs
You never had a heart of your own,
(You never did, right from the start)
Insane should be put inside,
You're a sewer rat decaying in a cesspool of pride
Should be made unemployed
Then make yourself null and void,
Make me feel good
I feel good.


I go out to work on a Monday morning
Tuesday I go off to honeymoon
I'll be back again before it's time for Sunny-down,
I'll be lazing on a Sunday afternoon
Bicycling on every Wednesday evening
Thursday I go waltzing to the Zoo
I come from London town, I'm just an ordinary guy,
Fridays I go painting in the Louvre
I'm bound to be proposing on a Saturday night (There he goes again)
I'll be lazing on a Sunday
lazing on a Sunday
lazing on a Sunday Afternoon.


The machine of a dream, such a clean machine,
With the pistons a pumpin', and the hubcaps all gleam.
When I'm holding your wheel,
All I hear is your gear,
When my hand's on your grease gun,
Oh it's like a disease son,
I'm in love with my car, gotta feel for my automobile,
Get a grip on my boy racer rollbar,
Such a thrill when your radials squeal.
Told my girl I just had to forget her,
Rather buy me a new cartburettor,
So she made tracks sayin' ths is the end now,
Cars don't talk back they're just four wheeled friends now,
When I'm holding your wheel,
All I hear is your gear,
When I'm cruisin' in overdrive,
Don't have to listen to no run of the mill talk jive,
I'm in love with my car, gotta feel for my automobile,
I'm in love with my car, string back gloves in my automolove!


Ooh, you make me live
Whatever this world can give to me
It's you, you're all I see
Ooh, you make me live now honey
Ooh, you make me live
You're the best friend
That I ever had
I've been with you such a long time
You're my sunshine
And I want you to know
That my feelings are true
I really love you
You're my best friend
Ooh, you make me live
I've been wandering round
But I still come back to you
In rain or shine
You've stood by me girl
I'm happy at home (happy at home)
You're my best friend.
Ooh, you make me live
Whenever this world is cruel to me
I got you to help me forgive
Ooh, you make me live now honey
Ooh, you make me live
You're the first one
When things turn out bad
You know I'll never be lonely
You're my only one
And I love the things
I really love the things that you do
You're my best friend
Ooh, you make me live.
I'm happy, happy at home
You're my best friend
You're my best friend
Ooh, you make me live
You, you're my best friend.


In the year of '39 assembled here the Volunteers
In the days when lands were few
Here the ship sailed out into the blue and sunny morn
The sweetest sight ever seen.
And the night followed day
And the story tellers say
That the score brave souls inside
For many a lonely day sailed across the milky seas
Never looked back, never feared, never cried.
Don't you hear my call though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you
Write your letters in the sand
For the day I take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew.
In the year of '39 came a ship in from the blue
The volunteers came home that day
And they bring good news of a world so newly born
Though their hearts so heavily weigh
For the earth is old and grey, little darling we'll away
But my love this cannot be
For so many years have gone though I'm older but a year
Your mother's eyes from your eyes cry to me.
Don't you hear my call though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you
Write your letters in the sand
For the day I take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew.
Don't you hear my call though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you
All your letters in the sand cannot heal me like your hand
For my life
Still ahead
Pity Me.


You call me up and treat me like a dog
You call me up and tear me up inside
You've got me on a lead
You bring me down
You shout around
You don't believe that I'm alone.
Sweet Lady
Sweet Lady
Sweet Lady...Stay sweet.
You say
"You call me up and feed me all the lines
"You call me sweet lime I'm some kind of cheese
"Waiting on the shelf
"You eat me up
"You hold me down
"I'm just a fool to make you a home
"And you say
"Sweet lady
"Sweet lady
"Sweet lady...Stay sweet."
My Sweet lady
Though it seems like we wait forever
Stay sweet baby
Believe and we've got everything we need.


Seaside
Whenever you stroll along with me I'm merely contemplating what you feel inside
Meanwhile
I ask you to be my Clementine
You say you will if you could but you can't
I love you madly
Let my imagination run away with you gladly
A brand new angle
Highly commendable
Seaside Rendezvous
I feel so romantic. Can we do it again?
Can we do it again sometime? (ooh I like that)
Fantastic, c'est la vie Madames et Monsieurs
And at the peak of the season, the Mediterranean
This time of year it's so fashionable,
I feel like dancing in the rain,
Can I have a volunteer?
Just keep right on dancing
What a damn jolly good idea -
It's such a jollification as a matter of fact, so tres charmant, my dear
Underneath the moonlight
Together we'll sail across the sea reminiscing every night (shine on silvery moonlight)
Meantime (in the meantime, baby)
I ask you to be my Valentine
You say you'd have to tell your daddy if you can
I'll be your Valentino
We'll ride upon an omnibus and then the casino
Get a new facial
Start a sensation
Seaside Rendezvous — so adorable,
Seaside Rendezvous — ooh hoo
Seaside Rendezvous — give us a kiss


Oh Oh people of earth
Listen to the warning
The seer he said
Beware the storm that gathers here
Listen to the wise man.
I dreamed I saw on a moonlit stair
Spreading his hands on the multitude there
A man who cried for a love gone stale
And ice cold hearts of charity bare.
I watched as fear took the old men's gaze
Hopes of the young in troubled graves
I see no day, I heard him say
So grey is the face of every mortal.
Oh Oh people of earth
Listen to the warning
The prophet he said
For soon the cold of night will fall
Summoned by your own hand.
Oh Oh children of the land
Quicken to the new life
Take my hand
Fly and find the new green bough
Return like the white dove.
He told of death as a done white haze
Taking the lost and the unloved babe
Late too late all the wretches run
These kinds of beasts now counting their days.
From mother's love is the son estranged
Married his own his precious gain
The earth will shake in two will break
And death all round will be your dowry
Oh oh people of the earth
Listen to the warning the seer he said
For those who hear and mark my words
Listen to the good plan
Oh oh oh oh and two by two my human zoo
They'll be running for to come
Running for to come out of the rain
Oh flee for your life 
Who heed me not let all your treasure make you 
Oh fear for your life
Deceive you not the fires of hell will take you
Should death await you
Ah people can you hear me?
And now I know and now I know
And now I know and now I know
That you can hear me
And now I know and now I know
And now I know Now I know
Now I know now I know
Now I know now I know
Now I know
The earth will shake in two will break
Death all around around around around 
Around around around around
Now I know now I know
Now I know now I know
Now I know now I know
Now I know now I know
Now I know now I know
Now I know
Wo wo wo wo wo wo wo wo wo
Listen to the wise listen to the wise listen to the wise
Listen to the wise listen to the wise man
La la
La la la la la la

Come Here (I - You)
Come Here (I - You)
Come Here (I - You)
Come Here (I - You)
Ah ah ah ah ah
Listen to the man listen to the man listen to the man listen 
to the mad man
God gave you grace to purge this place
And peace all around may be your fortune
Oh oh children of the land
Love is still the answer take my hand
The vision fades a voice I hear
Listen to the madman!
But still I fear and still I dare not
Laugh at the madman!


Love of my life, you've hurt me,
You've broken my heart and now you leave me.
Love of my life can't you see,
Bring it back, bring it back,
Don't take it away from me because you don't know what it means to me.
Love of my life, don't leave me,[Album version:] You've taken my love, you now desert me,[Live version:] You've stolen my love, you now desert me,
Love of my life, can't you see?
Bring it back, bring it back,
Don't take it away from me because you don't know what it means to me.
You will remember
When this is blown over
And everything's all by the way
When I grow older
I will be there at your side to remind you how I still love you, I still love you.[Album version:] Back, hurry back,[Live version:] Hurry back, hurry back,[Album version:] Please, bring it back home to me because you don't know what it means to me.[Live version:] Don't take it away from me, because you don't know what it means to me -
Love of my life
Love of my life...


Take good core of what you've got
My father said to me
As he puffed his pipe and Baby B.
He dandled on his knee
Don't fool with fools who'll turn away
Keep all Good Company
Oo Hoo Oo Hoo
Take care of those you call your own
And keep Good Company
Soon I grew and happy too
My very good friends and me
We'd play all day and Sally J.
The girl from number four
And very soon I begged her won't you
Keep me Company
Now marriage is an insinuation sure
My wife and I our needs and nothing more
All my friends by a year
By and by disappear
But we're safe enough behind our door.
I flourished in my humble trade
My reputation grew
The work devoured my waking hours
But when my time was through
Reward of all my efforts my own
Limited Company
I hardly noticed Sall as we
Pated Company
All through the years in the end it appears
There was never really anyone but me
Now I'm old I puff my pipe
But no-one's there to see
I ponder on the lesson of
My life's insanity
Take care of those you call your own
And Keep Good Company


Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide,
No escape from reality.
Open your eyes,
Look up to the skies and see,
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy,
Because I'm easy come, easy go,
Little high, little low,
Anyway the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me.
Mama, just killed a man,
Put a gun against his head,
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead.
Mama, life had just begun,
But now I've gone and thrown it all away.
Mama, ooh,
Didn't mean to make you cry,
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow,
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters.
Too late, my time has come,
Sent shivers down my spine,
Body's aching all the time.
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go,
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth.
Mama, ooh (anyway the wind blows),
I don't wanna die,
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all.
I see a little silhouetto of a man,
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning,
Very, very frightening me.
(Galileo) Galileo.
(Galileo) Galileo,
Galileo Figaro
Magnifico.
I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me.
He's just a poor boy from a poor family,
Spare him his life from this monstrosity.
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go. (Let him go!)
Bismillah! We will not let you go. (Let him go!)
Bismillah! We will not let you go. (Let me go!)
Will not let you go. (Let me go!)
Never, never let you go
Never let me go, oh.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Oh, mama mia, mama mia (Mama mia, let me go.)
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me.
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby,
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here.
(Oh, yeah, oh yeah)
Nothing really matters,
Anyone can see,
Nothing really matters,
Nothing really matters to me.
Anyway the wind blows.


Get your party gown
Get your pigtail down
Get your heart beatin' baby
Got my timin' right
Got my act all tight
It's gotta be tonight my little
Schoolbabe
Your momma says you don't
And your Daddy says you won't
And I'm boilin' up inside
Ain't no way I'm gonna lose out this time
Tie your Mother down
Tie your Mother down
Lock your Daddy out of doors
I don't need him nosing around
Tie your Mother down
Tie your Mother down
Give me all your love tonight
You're such a dirty louse
Go get outta my house
That's all I ever get from your
Family ties, in fact I don't think I ever heard
A single little civil word
from those guys
But you know I don't give a light
I'm gonna make out all right
I've got a sweetheart hand
To put a stop to all that
Grousin' an' snipin'
Tie your Mother down
Tie your Mother down
Take your little brother swimmin'
With a brick (that's all right)
Tie your Mother down,
Tie your Mother down
Or you ain't no friend of mine
Your momma and your Daddy gonna
Plague me til I die
Why can't they understand I'm just a
Peace lovin' guy
Tie your Mother down
Tie your Mother down. . .etc etc. . .


Look into my eyes and you'll see
I'm the only one
You've captured my love
Stolen my heart
Changed my life
Every time you make a move
You destroy my mind
And the way you touch
I lose control and shiver deep inside
You take my breath away
You can reduce me to tears
With a single sigh
Every breath that you take -
Any sound that you make
Is a whisper in my ear
I could give up all my life for just one kiss
I would surely die
If you dismiss me from your love
You take my breath away
So please don't go
Don't leave me here all by myself
I get ever so lonely from time to time
I will find you
Anywhere you go, I'll be right behind you
Right until the ends of the earth
I'll get no sleep till I find you to tell you
That you just take my breath
away
I will find you...etc
I'll get no sleep til I find you to
tell you when I've found you -
I love you


You might believe in heaven
I would not care to say
For every star in heaven
There's a sad soul here today
Wake up in the morning with a good face
Stare at the moon all day
Lonely as a whisper on a star chase
Does anyone care anyway
For all the prayers in heaven
So much of life's this way
Did we leave our way behind us
Such a long long way behind us
Who knows when, now who knows where
Where the light of day will find us?
Look for the day
Take heart, my friend, we love you
Though it seems like you're alone
A million lights above you
Smile down upon your home
Hurry put your troubles in a suitcase
Come let the new child play
Lonely as a whisper on a star chase
I'm leaving here, I'm long away
For all the stars in heaven
I would not live
I could not live this way
Did we leave our way behind us
Such a long way behind us
Leave it for some hopeless lane
Such a long long way
such a long long way
such a long long away
I'm looking for
Still looking for that day


Bring out the charge of the love brigade
There is spring in the air once again
Drink to the sound of the song parade
There is music and love everywhere
Give a little love to me
Take a little love from me,
I want to share it with you
I feel like a millionaire
Once we were mad, we were happy
We spent all our days holding hands together
Do you remember, my love
How we danced and played
In the rain we laid
Could stay there, forever and ever
Now I am sad
You are so far away
I sit counting the hours day by day
Come back to me, how I long for your love
Come back to me - be happy like
we used to be Come back to me, oh my love
How I long for your love - won't you come back to me, yeah
My fine friend - take me with you and love me forever -
My fine friend - forever - ever[Repeat verse]
Come back, come back to me, make me feel - Like a millionaire


Music is playing in the darkness
And a lantern goes swinging by
Shadows flickering
My heart's jittering
Just you and I
Not tonight
Come tomorrow
When everything's sunny and bright
No No No
Come tomorrow
Cos then we'll be waiting for the moonlight
We'll go walking in the moonlight
Walking in the moonlight
Laughter ringing in the darkness
People drinking for days gone by
Time don't mean a thing
When you're by my side
Please stay a while
You know I never could foresee the future years
You know I never could see
where life was leading me
But will we be together for ever
What will be my love, can't you see that I just don't know
No no not tonight
Come tomorrow
When everything's gonna be alright
Wait and see
If tomorrow
We'll be as happy as we're feeling tonight
We'll go walking in the moonlight
Walking in the moonlight
I can hear the music in the darkness
Floating softly to where to lie
No more questions now
Let's enjoy tonight
Just you and I
Just you and I


Can anybody find me somebody to love?
Each morning I get up I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet
Take a look in the mirror and cry
Lord what you're doing to me
I have spent all my years in believing you
But I just can't get no relief,
Lord!
Somebody, somebody
Can anybody find me somebody to love?
I work hard every day of my life
I work till I ache my bones
At the end I take home my hard earned pay all on my own -
I get down on my knees
And I start to pray
Till the tears run down from my eyes
Lord - somebody - somebody
Can anybody find me - somebody to love?
(He works hard)
Everyday - I try and I try and I try -
But everybody wants to put me down
They say I'm goin' crazy
They say I got a lot of water in my brain
Got no common sense
I got nobody left to believe
Yeah - yeah yeah yeah
Oh Lord
Somebody - somebody
Can anybody find me somebody to love?
Got no feel, I got no rhythm
I just keep losing my beat
I'm ok, I'm alright
Ain't gonna face no defeat
I just gotta get out of this prison cell
Someday I'm gonna be free, Lord!
Find me somebody to love
Can anybody find me somebody to love?
Gospel Choir - Roger, Brian & Freddie


I'm a simple man
With a simple name
From this soil my people came
In this soil remain
Oh yeah. . .
And we made us our shoes
And we trod soft on the land
But the immigrant built roads
On our blood and sand
Oh yeah. . .
White man, white man
Don't you see the light behind your blackened skies
White man, white man
You took away sight to blind my simple eyes
White man, white man
Where you gonna hide
From the hell you've made?
Oh the red man knows war
With his hands and his knives
On the Bible you swore
Fought your battle with lies
Oh yeah. . .
Leave my body in shame
Leave my soul in disgrace
But by every God's name
Say your prayers for your race
White man, white man
Our country was green and all our rivers wide
White man, white man
You came with a gun and soon our children died
White man, white man
Don't you give a light for the blood you've shed?
What is left of your dream?
Just the words on your stone
A man who learned how to teach
Then forget how to learn


I can dim the lights and sing you songs full of sad things
We can do the tango just for two
I can serenade and gently play on your heart strings
Be your Valentino just for you
Ooh love, ooh loverboy
What're you doin' tonight, hey, boy?
Set my alarm, turn on my charm
That's because I'm a good old-fashioned loverboy
Ooh, let me feel your heartbeat (grow faster, faster)
Ooh, ooh, can you feel my love heat?
Come on and sit on my hot-seat of love
And tell me how do you feel right after all
I'd like for you and I to go romancing
Say the word: your wish is my command
Ooh love, ooh loverboy
What're you doin' tonight, hey, boy?
Write my letter
Feel much better
And use my fancy patter on the telephone
When I'm not with you
Think of you always
(I miss those long hot summer nights)
I miss you
When I'm not with you
Think of me always
Love you, love you
Hey, boy, where do you get it from?
Hey, boy, where did you go?
I learned my passion
In the good old-fashioned
School of loverboys
Dining at the Ritz we'll meet at nine precisely
(one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine o'clock)
I will pay the bill, you taste the wine
Driving back in style, in my saloon will do quite nicely
Just take me back to yours that will be fine (come on and get it)
Ooh love (there he goes again),
(he's my good old fashioned loverboy) ooh loverboy
What're you doin' tonight, hey, boy?
Everything's all right
Just hold on tight
That's because I'm a good old-fashioned (fashioned) loverboy


It's the sad-eyed, goodbye, yesterday moments I remember It's the bleak
street, weak-kneed partings I recall It's the mistier mist
The hazier days
The brighter sun
And the easier lays
There's all the more reason for laughing and crying
When you're younger and life isn't too hard at all
It's the fantastic drowse of the afternoon Sundays
That bored you to rages of tears
The unending pleadings, to waste all your good times
In thoughts of your middle aged years
It's a vertical hold, all the things that you're told
For the everyday hero it all turns to zero
And there's all the more reason for living or dying
When you're young and your troubles are all very small
Out here on the street
We'd gather and meet
And scuff up the sidewalk with endlessly restless feet
Half of the time
We'd broaden our minds
More in the poolhall than we did in the schoolahll
With the downtown chewing-gum bums
Watching the nightlife, the lights and the fun
Never wanted to be the boy next door
Always thought I'd be something more
But it ain't easy for a downtown boy
It ain't easy at all
Thinkin' it right, doin' it wrong
It's easier from an armchair
Waves of alternatives wash at my sleepiness Have my eggs poached for
breakfast I guess


When I'm gone
Don't stop to wonder if I ever think of you
The same moon shines
The same wind blows
For both of us, and time is but a paper moon. . . be not gone
Though I'm gone
It's just as though I hold the flower that touches you
A new life grows
The blossom knows
There's no one else could warm my heart as much as you. . . be not gone
Let us cling together as the years go by
Oh my love, my love
In the quiet of the night
Let our candle always burn
Let us never lose the lessons we have learned
Teo Torriate konomama iko
Aisuruhito yo
Shizukana yoi ni
Hikario tomoshi
Itoshiki oshieo idaki
Hear my song
Still think of me the way you've come to think of me
The nights grow long
But dreams live on
Just close your pretty eyes and you can be with me. . . dream on
When I'm gone
They'd say we're all fools and we don't understand
Oh be strong
Don't turn your heart
You're all
We're all
For all
For always. . .

I've paid my dues
Time after time.
I've done my sentence
But committed no crime.
And bad mistakes ‒
I've made a few.
I've had my share of sand kicked in my face
But I've come through.
(And I need just go on and on, and on, and on)
We are the champions, my friends,
And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end.
We are the champions.
We are the champions.
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions of the world.
I've taken my bows
And my curtain calls
You brought me fame and fortune and everything that goes with it
I thank you all
But it's been no bed of roses,
No pleasure cruise.
I consider it a challenge before the whole human race
And I ain't gonna lose.
(And I need just go on and on, and on, and on)
We are the champions, my friends,
And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end.
We are the champions.
We are the champions.
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions of the world.
We are the champions, my friends,
And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end.
We are the champions.
We are the champions.
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions.


Well you're just 17 and all you wanna do is disappear
You know what I mean there's a lot of space between your ears
The way that you touch don't feel nothin'
Hey hey hey hey, it was the DNA
Hey hey hey hey, that made me this way
Do you know, do you know, do you know, just how I feel
Do you know, do you know, do you know, just how I feel
Sheer heart attack
Sheer heart attack
Real cardiac
I feel so in-articulate
Gotta feelin', gotta feelin', gotta feelin', like I'm paralysed
It ain't no, it ain't no, it ain't no, it ain't no surprise
Turn on the TV let it drip right down in your eyes
Hey hey hey hey, it was the DNA
Hey hey hey hey, that made me this way
Do you know, do you know, do you know, just how I feel
Do you know, do you know, do you know, just how I feel
Sheer heart attack
Sheer heart attack
Real cardiac
I feel so in-articulate
Do you know, do you know, do you know just how I feel
Do you know, do you know, do you know just how I feel
Do you know, do you know, do you know just how I feel
Do you know, do you know, do you know, do you know just how I feel
Sheer heart attack
Sheer heart attack
Real cardiac


Memories, my memories
How long can you stay
To haunt my days
She came without a farthing
A babe without a name
So much ado about nothing
Is what she'd try to say
So much ado my lover
So many games we played
Through every fleeted summer
Through every precious day
All Dead All Dead
All the dreams we had
And I wonder why I still live on
All Dead All Dead
And alone I'm spared
My sweeter half instead
All Dead
And Gone
All Dead...
All Dead All Dead
At the rainbow's end
And still I hear her own sweet song
All Dead All Dead
Take me back again
You know my little friend's
All Dead
And gone
All Dead and gone
Her ways are always with me
I wander all the while
But please you must forgive me
I am old but still a child
All Dead All Dead
But I should not grieve
In time it comes to everyone
All Dead All Dead
But in hope I breathe
Of course I don't believe
You're dead
And gone
All Dead
And gone


Sammy was low
Just watching the show
Over and over again
Knew it was time
He'd made up his mind
To leave his dead life behind
His boss said to him
"Boy you'd better begin
To get those crazy notions right out of your head
Sammy who do you think that you are?
You should've been sweeping up the Emerald Bar"
Spread your wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Spread your little wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Pull yourself together
'Cos you know you should do better
That's because you're a free man
He spends his evenings alone in his hotel room
Keeping his thoughts to himself, he'd be leaving soon
Wishing he was miles and miles away
Nothing in this world, nothing would make him stay
Since he was small
Had no luck at all
Nothing came easy to him
Now it was time
He'd made up his mind
"This could be my last chance"
His boss said to him, "Now listen boy!
You're always dreaming
You've got no real ambition, you won't get very far
Sammy boy, don't you know who you are?
Why can't you be happy at the Emerald Bar?"
So honey
Spread your wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Spread your little wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Pull yourself together
'Cos you know you should do better
That's because you're a free man


Hey you boy, think that you know what you're doing
You think you're gonna set things to rights
You're just another picture on a teenage wall
You're just another sucker ready for a fall
You gotta
Fight from the inside
Attack from the rear
Fight from the inside
You can't win with your hands tied
Fight from the inside
Fight from the inside
Right down the line -
Hey you boy think that you know what you're doing
You think that out in the streets is all free
You're just another money-spinner tool
You're just another fool
You gotta
Fight from the inside
Attack from the rear
Fight from the inside
You can't win with your hands tied
Fight from the inside
Fight from the inside
Right down the line -


Get down make love
Get down make love
Get down make love
Get down make love -
You take my body -
I give you heat
You say you're hungry
I give you meat
I suck your mind
You blow my head
Make love -
Inside your bed - everybody get down make love
Get down make love
Get down make love
Get down make love
Everytime I get hot
You wanna cool down
Everytime I get high
You say you wanna come down
You say it's enough
In fact it's too much
Everytime I get a - Get down, get down
Make love -
I can squeeze - You can shake me
I can feel - when you break me
Come on so heavy - when you take me -
You make love, you make love, you make love, you make love
You can make everybody get down make love
Get down make love
Everytime I get high
You wanna come down
Everytime I get hot
You say you wanna cool down
You say it's enough
In fact it's too much
Everytime I wanna, get down, get down get down -
Get down make love
Get down make love
Get down make love


I was nothin' but a city boy
My trumpet was my only toy
I've been blowin' my horn
Since I knew I was born
But there ain't nobody wants to know
I've been
Sleepin' on the sidewalk
Rollin' down the road
I may get hungry
But I sure don't want to go home
So round the corner comes a limousine
And the biggest grin I've ever seen
Come on sonny won't you sign
Right along the dotted line
What you sayin' Are you playin'
Sure you don't mean me?
Sleepin' on the sidewalk
Rollin' down the road
I may get hungry
But I sure don't wanna go home
(tell you what happened. . .)
They took me to a room without a table
They said "blow your trumpet into here"
I played around as well as I was able
And soon we had the record of the year
I was a legend all through the land
I was blowin' to a million fans
Nothin' was a-missin'
All the people want to listen
You'd have thought I was a happy man
And I was
Sleepin' like a princess
Never touch the road
I don't get hungry
And I sure don't want to go home
(have to have some fun. . .)
Now they tell me that I ain't so fashionable
An' I owe the man a million bucks a year
So I told 'em where to stick the fancy label
It's just me and the road from here
Back to playin' and layin'
I'm back on the game
Sleepin' on the sidewalk
Rollin' down the road
I sure get hungry and I
Sure do wanna go home
(Yeah)


I make it half past six you come at seven
Always trying to keep me, hanging round
You little spoilt thing, girl you kept me waiting
Never contemplating my point of view
This comes as no surprise
I'm a fool, for I believed your lies
But now I've seen through your disguise
Who needs, well I don't need, who needs you?
Oh I believed you
Went on my knees to you
How I trusted you
But you turned me down
But it's dog eat dog in this rat race
And it leaves you bleeding lying flat on your face
Reaching out, reaching out for a helping hand
Where is that helping hand?
How I was pushed around
"Don't let it get you down"
You walked all over me
"But don't you ever give in"
Taking one step forward, slipping two steps back
There's an empty feeling that you can't forget
Reaching out, reaching out for a helping hand
When I met you, you were always charming
Couldn't sleep at night 'till you were mine
You were oh so so sophisticated
Never interested in what I'd say
I had to swallow my pride
So naive, you took me for a ride
But now I'm the one to decide
Who needs, well I don't need, who needs you?


[Scene 1]
You say you love me
And I hardly know your name
And if I say I love you in the candle light
There's no one but myself to blame
But there's something inside
That's turning my mind away
Oh how I could love you
If I could let you stay[Chorus:]
It's late - and I'm bleeding deep inside
It's late - is it just my sickly pride
Too late - even now the feeling seems to slip away
So late - though I'm crying I can't help but hear you say
It's late It's late It's late
But not too late[Scene 2]
The way you love me
Is the sweetest love around
But after all this time
The more I'm trying
The more I seem to let you down
Now you tell me you're leaving
And I just can't believe it's true
Oh you know that I can love you
Though you know I can't be true


Another party's over
And I'm left cold sober
My baby left me for somebody new
I don't wanna talk about it
Want to forget about it
Wanna be intoxicated with that special brew
So come and get me
Let me
Get in that sinking feeling
That says my heart is on an all time low - so
Don't expect me
To behave perfectly
And wear that sunny smile
My guess is I'm in for a cloudy and overcast
Don't try and stop me
'Cause I'm heading for that stormy weather soon
I'm causing a mild sensation
With this new occupation
I'm permanently glued
To this extraordinary mood, so now moveover
And let me take over
With my melancholy blues
I'm causing a mild sensation
With this new occupation
I'm in the news
I'm just getting used to my new exposure
Come into my enclosure
And meet my melancholy blues

Heap big woman, you made a bad boy out of me

Oh how wrong can you be?
Oh to fall in love was my very first mistake
How was I to know I was far too much in love to see?
Oh jealousy look at me now
Jealousy you got me somehow
You gave me no warning
Took me by surprise
Jealousy you led me on
You couldn't lose you couldn't fail
You had suspicion on my trail
How how how all my jealousy
I wasn't man enough to let you hurt my pride
Now I'm only left with my own jealousy
Oh how strong can you be
With matters of the heart?
Life is much too short
To while away with tears
If only you could see just what you do to me
Oh jealousy you tripped me up
Jealousy you brought me down
You bring me sorrow you cause me pain
Jealousy when will you let go?
Gotta hold of my possessive mind
Turned me into a jealous kind
How how how all my jealousy
I wasn't man enough to let you hurt my pride
Now I'm only left with my own jealousy
But now it matters not if I should live or die
'Cause I'm only left with my own jealousy

Monday the start of my holiday
Freedom for just one week
Feels good to get away ooh
Tuesday I saw here down on the beach
I stood and watched a while
And she looked and smiled at me
Wednesday I didn't see her
I hoped that she'd be back tomorrow
And then on Thursday my luck had changed
She stood there all alone
I went and asked her name
I never thought that this could happen to me
In only seven days
It would take a hundred or more
For memories to fade
I wish Friday could last forever
I held her close to me
I couldn't bear to leave her there
Saturday just twenty four hours
Oh no I'm going back home on Sunday
Ooh so sad alone


Oh I used to be your baby
Used to be your pride and joy
You used to take me dancing
Just like any other boy
But now you've found another partner
You've left me like a broken toy
Oh it's someone else you're taking
Someone else you're playing to
Honey though I'm aching
Know just what I have to do
If I can't have you when I'm waking
I'll go to sleep and dream I'm with you
Oh take me take me take me
To the dreamer's ball
I'll be right on time and I'll dress so fine
You're gonna love me when you see me
I won't have to worry
Take me, take me
Promise not to wake me
'Till it's morning
It's all been true
Oh take me take me take me
I'm your play thing now
You make my life worthwhile
With the slightest smile
Or destroy me with a barely perceptible whisper
Gently take me remember I'll be dreaming of my baby
At the dreamer's ball
Take me hold me
Remember what you told me
You'd meet me at the dreamer's ball
I'll meet you at the dreamer's ball

All you have to do
Is fall in love
Play the game,
Everybody play the game of love (yeah)
When you're feeling down and your resistance is low
Light another cigarette and let yourself go
This is your life
Don't play hard to get
It's a free world
All you have to do is fall in love
Play the game,
Everybody play the game of love
My game of love has just begun
Love runs from my head down to my toes
My love is pumping through my veins (play the game)
Driving me insane
Come, come, come play the game, play the game, play the game, play the game
Everybody play the game of love
This is your life
Don't play hard to get
It's a free, free world
All you have to do is fall in love
Play the game
Play the game of love
Your life
Don't play hard to get
It's a free, free world
All you have to do is fall in love
Play the game
Play the game of love


Take me to the room where the red's all red
Take me out of my head-'s what I said
Take me to the room where the green's all green
And from what I've seen it's hot, it's mean
Take me to the room where the beat's all round
Gonna eat that sound -(yeah yeah yeah)
Take me to the room where the blacks all white
And the white's are black, take me back to the shack
Low Down-She don't take no prisoners
Go Down-Gonna give me the business
No time-Yeah chained to the rack!
Show time-Got a Dragon on my back
Show down-Go find another customer
Slow down-I gotta make my way


Oh! Let's go!
Steve walks warily down the street
With the brim pulled way down low.
Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet,
Machine guns ready to go.
Are you ready, hey, are you ready for this?
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat?
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I'm gonna get you, too
Another one bites the dust
How do you think I'm going to get along
Without you when you're gone?
You took me for everything that I had
And kicked me out on my own
Are you happy, are you satisfied?
How long can you stand the heat?
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat[Chorus]
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
There are plenty of ways that you can hurt a man
And bring him to the ground
You can beat him, you can cheat him
You can treat him bad and leave him when he's down
But I'm ready, yes, I'm ready for you
I'm standing on my own two feet
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
Repeating to the sound of the beat[Chorus]


No I'll never, look back in anger,
No I'll never, find me an answer,
You promised me, you'd keep in touch
I read your letter and it hurt me so much
I said I'd never, never be angry with you.
I don't wanna feel like a stranger
Cos I'd rather be in danger
I read your letter so many times
I got your meaning between the lines
I said I'd never, never be angry with you
I must be strong so she won't know how much I miss her
I only hope as time goes on, I'll forget her
My body's aching, can't sleep at night
I'm too exhausted to start a fight
And if I see her with another guy
I'll eat my heart out 'cos I love her,
love her, love her, love her
Come on baby, let's get together
I'll love you baby, I'll love you forever
I'm trying hard, to stay away
What made you change, what did I say?
Ooh I need your loving tonight


This thing called love I just can't handle it
this thing called love I must get round to it
I ain't ready
Crazy little thing called love
This (This Thing) called love
(Called Love)
It cries (Like a baby)
In a cradle all night
It swings (Woo Woo)
It jives (Woo Woo)
It shakes all over like a jelly fish,
I kinda like it
Crazy little thing called love
There goes my baby
She knows how to Rock n' roll
She drives me crazy
She gives me hot and cold fever
Then she leaves me in a cool cool sweat
I gotta be cool relax, get hip
Get on my track's
Take a back seat, hitch-hike
And take a long ride on my motor bike
Until I'm ready
Crazy little thing called love
I gotta be cool relax, get hip
Get on my track's
Take a back seat, hitch-hike
And take a long ride on my motor bike
Until I'm ready (Ready Freddie)
Crazy little thing called love
This thing called love I just can't handle it
this thing called love I must get round to it
I ain't ready
Crazy little thing called love


When I hear that rock and roll,
It gets down to my soul,
When it's real rock and roll, oh rock and roll.
Oh Oh, Oh Oh,
You really think they like to rock in space?
Well I don't know
What do you know?
What do you hear?
On the radio
I said Mama
I ain't crazy
I'm alright - alright
Hey, c'mon baby said it's alright
To rock and roll on a Saturday night
I said shoot and get your suit and come along with me
I said c'mon baby down come and rock and roll with me, I said yeah.
What do you do?
To get to feel alive?
You go downtown
And get some of that prime jive,
I said Mama etc.
We're gonna rock it............ tonight.
(We want some prime jive)
(We want some prime jive)
We're gonna rock it tonight
C'mon honey
Get some of that prime jive
Get some of that, get, get down
C'mon honey - we're gonna rock it tonight.

Blow your brains out -
Don't do that - yeah[Chorus:]
Nobody gives - nobody gives
Nobody gives a damn


Hey little babe you're changing
Babe, are you feeling sore?
Ain't no use in pretending
You don't wanna play no more
It's plain that you ain't no baby
What would your mother say
You're all dressed up like a lady
How come you behave this way
Sail Away Sweet Sister
Sail across the sea
Maybe you find somebody
Who loves you half as much as me
My heart is always with you
No matter what you do
Sail away sweet sister
Always be in love with you
Forgive me for what I told you
My heart makes a fool of me
You know I'll never hold you
I know that you gotta be free
Sail Away Sweet Sister
Sail across the sea
Maybe you find somebody
Who loves you half as much as me
Take it the way you want it
But when they let you down my friend
Sail away sweet sister
Back to my arms again
Hot child don't you know, you're young -
You've got your whole life ahead of you
Oohah - You can throw it away too soon
Way too soon


Oooooooooo [xn]
Oh Oh Oh [xn]
I get some headaches when I hit the heights
Like in the morning after crazy nights
Like some month in law in her nylon tights
They're always
They're always
They're always
They're always
Coming soon,
Coming soon, on the outside, of the tracks,
You take 'em
The same old babies with the same old toys,
The neighbours screaming when the noise annoys,
Somebody naggin' you when you're out with the boys
They're always
They're always
They're always
They're always
Coming soon,
Coming soon, on the outside, of the track
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah.
Watch me now,
They're always
They're always
They're always
They're always
Coming soon,
Coming soon, on the outside, of the track
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah.


It started off so well
They said we made a perfect pair
I clothed myself in your glory and your love
How I loved you,
How I cried.....
The years of care and loyalty
Were nothing but a sham it seems
The years belie we lived a lie
"I'll love you 'til I die"
Save me Save me Save me
I can't face this life alone
Save me Save me Oh...
I'm naked and I'm far from home
The slate will soon be clean
I'll erase the memories,
To start again with somebody new
Was it all wasted
All that love?.....
I hang my head and I advertise
A soul for sale or rent
I have no heart, I'm cold inside
I have no real intent
Save me Save me Save me
I can't face this life alone
Save me Save me Oh...
I'm naked and I'm far from home
Each night I cry, I still believe the lie
I'll love you 'til I die


Let me show it to you
See what I got
I got a heel of a lot
Tell me what you feel
Is it real
It is real
You know I got what it takes
And I can take a lot
Did you hear the last call baby
You and me got staying power
Staying power I got it I got it
I wonder when we're gonna make it
I wonder when we're gonna shake it
Rock me baby rock me
C'mon you can shock me
Let's catch on to the groove
Make it move, make it move
You know how to shake that thing
We'll work it, work it , work it
You and I can play ball baby
You and me got staying power
I wonder when we're gonna make it
I wondows when we're gonna shake it
I've got fire down below
I'm just a regular dynamo
Want some smooth company
Don't lose control just hang on out with me
Got to get to know each other
But we got plenty of time
Did you hear the last call baby
You and me got staying power
You and me we got staying power
Power
I wonder where we're gonna stick it
I wonder when we're gonna trick it
Blow baby blow
Let's get down and go go
Get yourself in the mood
Got to give a little bit of attitude
Baby don't you crash
Let's just trash trash trash
Did you hear the last call baby
You and me got staying power
You and me we got staying power
Staying power... got'cha


I'm not invited to the party
Been sitting here all night
I'm all alone here at the party
Ain't got no black coat
Ain't got no tie
I gotta shape up now
You gotta know why
Dancer, Dancer
I can't live with it I'm gonna die without it
Dancer, Dancer
Ain't no doubt about it
Dancer, Dancer
Why don't you kick off your dancing shoes
And come along with me
You're the life and soul of the funk-tion
It took me all night
To get hold of the right introduction
Blew me out of sight
I taste your lipstick
I look in your eyes
You feel fantastic
My body cries[CHORUS]
(HOT SPACE)
Dancer, Dancer
I can't believe your dancing
Can't take you home, can't take your dancing
Dancer, Dancer, dance the night away

Action
This street honey is a mean street
Living in this street honey needs a mean
streak
We've got criminals living in this street
But there's a heartbeat pulse that keeps on
pumping
Like a jukebox playing the same dead record
Or a radio in the corner keeps blaring
I gotta feeling, this world is using me
This town honey is a dead town
Living in this town honey is a showdown
But there's a heartbeat pulse that keep in
pumping
Some sunshine ray through a crack in a
shutter
Or a sight of a light at
The end of a tunnel
Still there's a feeling, this world is using me
Action this day
Action this night
We've gotta learn to learn to live to love
You can't say it ain't right
Action this day
Action this night
You've got the power, you've got the power
You've got the power to love and to live
You can't say it ain't right
Your mind honey is a bleak place
Living in your mind's living in a bleak place
Your mind is coming from a rat race
But there's a heartbeat pulse that keeps on
pumping
Like a jukebox playing the same dead record
Or a radio in the corner keeps blaring
I gotta feeling that just won't quit, this
world is using me
Action this day
Action this night
We've gotta learn to learn to live to love
We can't say it ain't right
Action this day
Action this night
You've got the power, you've got the power
You've got the power to love, to live
You can't say it ain't right
Action
Action this day


They called him a hero
In the land of the free
But he wouldn't shake my hand boy
He disappointed me
So I got my handgun
And I blew him away
That critter was a bad guy
I had to make him pay
You might fear for my reason
I don't care what they say
Look out baby it's the season
For the mad masquerade
Put out the fire
You need a bullet like a hole in the head
Put out the fire
Don't believe what your grandaddy said
She was my lover
It was a shame that she died
But the constitution's right on my side
Cos I caught my lover in my neighbour's bed
I got retribution, filled 'em full of lead
I've been told it's the fashion
To let me on the streets again
It's nothing but a crime of passion
And I'm not to blame
Put out the fir
And let your sons and your daughters
Sleep sound in their beds
You know a gun never killed nobody
You can ask anyone
People get shot by people
People with guns
Put out the fire
You need a gun like a hole in the head
Out out the fire
Just tell me that old fashioned gun law!!!!!!
is dead


Guilt stains on my pillow
Blood on my terraces
Torsos in my closet
Shadows from my past live is real
Life is real, life is real, so real
Sleeping is my leisure
Waking up in a minefield
Dream is just a pleasure dome
Love is a roulette wheel - life is real
Life is real, life is real, oh yeah
Success is my breathing space
I brought it on myself
I will price it
I will cash it
I can take it or leave it
Loneliness is my hiding place
Breastfeeding myself
What more can I say
I have swallowed the bitter pill
I can taste it, I can taste it
Life is real, life is real, life is real
Music will be my mistress
Loving like a whore
Lennon is a genius
Living in every pore
Life is real, life is real, life is real, so real
Life is cruel
Life is a bitch
Life is real - so real


Calling all girls

Love

Don't touch me now
Don't hold me now
Don't break the spell darling, now you are
near
Look in my eyes
And speak to me
The special promises I want to hear
Las palabras de amor
Let me hear the words of love
Despacito mi amor
Love me slow and gently
One foolish world, so many souls
Senselessly hurled through the never ending
cold
And all for fear, and all for greed
Speak any tongue but for God's sake we
need
Las palabras de amor
Let me hear the words of love
Despacito mi amor
Let me know, this night and evermore
This room is bare
This night is cold
We're apart and I'm growing old
But while we live, we'll meet again
So then my love we may whisper once more
It's you I adore
Las palabras de amor
Let me hear the words of love
Despacito mi amor
Touch me now
Las palabras de amor
Let us share the words of love
For evermore
For evermore


You're taking all the sunshine away
Making out like you're the mainline - I knew that
Cos you're a cool cat
Tapping on the toe with a new hat
Just cruising - driving along like the swing king
Feeling the beat of my heart
Feeling the beat of my heart
You're a cool cat
Coming on strong with all the chit-chat
You're alright
Hanging out and stealing all the limelight
Messing with the beat of my heart
Messing with the beat of my heart
You used to be a mean kid
Making such a deal of life
You were wishing and hoping wand waiting to
really hit the big time
But did it happen, happen, no
You're speeding too fast
Slow down Slow down
You'd better slow down
Slow down
You really know how to set the mood
And you really get inside the groove
Cool cat
Tapping on the toe with a new hat
Just cuising
Driving along like the swing king
Feeling the beat of my heart
Feeling the beat of my heart - yeah yeah
Feeling the beat of my heart


Pressure pushing down on me
Pressing down on you, no man ask for
Under pressure that burns a building down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets
It's the terror of knowing
What this world is about
Watching some good friends
Screaming, "Let me out!"
Tomorrow gets me higher
Pressure on people - people on streets
Chippin' around, kick my brains 'round the floor
These are the days - it never rains but it pours
People on streets - people on streets
It's the terror of knowing
What this world is about
Watching some good friends
Screaming, "Let me out!"
Tomorrow gets me higher, higher, higher...
Pressure on people - people on streets
Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence but it don't work
Keep coming up with love but it's so slashed and torn
Why, why, why?
Love
Insanity laughs under pressure we're cracking
Can't we give ourselves one more chance?
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love, give love, give love, give love, give love?..
'Cause love's such an old-fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance
This is ourselves
Under pressure
Under pressure
Pressure


Radio.
Radio.
I'd sit alone and watch your light
My only friend through teenage nights
And everything I had to know
I heard it on my radio
You gave them all those old time stars
Through wars of worlds invaded by Mars
You made 'em laugh, you made 'em cry
You made us feel like we could fly.
Radio.
So don't become some background noise
A backdrop for the girls and boys
Who just don't know or just don't care
And just complain when you're not there
You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio, Radio.
All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga
All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio blah blah
Radio, what's new?
Radio, someone still loves you!
We watch the shows, we watch the stars
On videos for hours and hours
We hardly need to use our ears
How music changes through the years.
Let's hope you never leave old friend
Like all good things on you we depend
So stick around 'cause we might miss you
When we grow tired of all this visual
You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio, Radio.
All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga
All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga
All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio blah blah
Radio, what's new?
Someone still loves you!
Radio ga ga [3x]
You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio, Radio.

I don't want my freedom
There's no reason for living with a broken heart.
This is a tricky situation -
I've only got myself to blame
It's just a simple fact of life
It can happen to anyone -
You win - you lose
It's a chance you have to take with love
Oh yeah - I fell in love
But now you say it's over and I'm falling apart.
It's a hard life
To be true lovers together
To love and live forever in each others hearts -
It's a long hard fight
To learn to care for each other
To trust in one another right from the start
When you're in love -
I try and mend the broken pieces
I try to fight back the tears
They say it's just a state of mind
But it happens to everyone -
How it hurts - deep inside
When your love has cut you down to size
Life is tough - on your own
Now I'm waiting for something to fall from the skies
Waiting for love.
Yes it's a hard life
Two lovers together
To love and live forever in each others hearts
It's a long hard fight
To learn to care for each other
To trust in one another - right from the start
When you're in love -
Yes it's a hard life
In a world that's filled with sorrow
There are people searching for love in every way -
It's a long hard fight -
But I'll always live for tomorrow
I'll look back on myself and say I did it for love
Yes I did it for love - for love - oh I did it for love.


I'm gonna take a little walk on the wild side
I'm gonna loosen up and get me some gas
I'm gonna get me some action
Go crazy, driving in the fast lane
My baby left me alone
She done me dirty and I'm feeling so lonely
So come home, come home
If you don't you're gonna break my heart.
Man on the prowl
You better watch out
I'm on the loose and I'm looking for trouble
So look out - look out
I'm a man on the prowl.
I don't wanna be a rock 'n' roll steady
I just wanna be low down trash
I wanna go to the movies
All I wanna do is sit on my ass
So honey come home
Don't leave me when I'm feeling so lonely
Come home - come home
If you don't you're gonna break my heart.
Man on the prowl
You better watch out
I'm on the loose and I'm looking for trouble
So look out - look out
I'm a man on the prowl.
Well I keep dreaming about my baby
But it ain't gonna get me nowhere
I wanna teach my baby dancin'
But I ain't no Fred Astaire.
So baby look out - I'm a man on the prowl
Look out - man on the prowl - yeah
Baby, baby, baby look out - man on the prowl.
Baby come home
I'm on the loose and I'm looking for trouble
Baby come home - oh yeah
Cause I'm a man on the prowl
So honey come home - come home
Cause I'm a man on the prowl - yeah
Man on the prowl.


It's a Machine's world
Don't tell me I ain't got no soul
When the machines take over
It ain't no place for you and me.
They tell me I don't care
But deep inside I'm just a man
They freeze me they burn me
They squeeze me they stress me
With smoke-blackened pistons of steel they compress me
But no-one, but no-one, but no-one can wrest me away
Back to Humans.
We have no disease, no troubles of mind
No thank you please, no regard for the time
We never cry, we never retreat
We have no conception of love or defeat.
What's that Machine noise
It's bytes and megachips for tea
It's that Machine, boys
With Random Access Memory
Never worry, never mind
Not for money, not for gold.
It's software it's hardware
It's heartbeat is time-share
It's midwife's a disk drive
It's sex-life is quantised
It's self-perpetuating a parahumanoidarianised.
Back to Humans
Back to Humans.
Back to Machines.
Living in a new world
Thinking in the past
Living in a new world
How you gonna last
Machine world...
It's a Machine's world...
Change.
Back to Humans.

Oh how I want to be free, baby
Oh how I want to be free,
Oh how I want to break free.
But life still goes on
I can't get used to, living without, living without,
Living without you by my side

So baby can't you see
I've got to break free.
I've got to break free
I want to break free, yeah
I want, I want, I want, I want to break free.


This is the only life for me
Surround myself around my own fantasy
You just gotta be strong and believe in yourself
Forget all the sadness cause love is all you need.
Do you know what it's like to be alone in this world
When you're down and out on your luck and you're a failure
Wake up screaming in the middle of the night
You think it's all been a waste of time
It's been a bad year
You start believing everything's gonna be alright
Next minute you're down and you're flat on your back
A brand new day is beginning
Get that sunny feeling and you're on your way.
Just believe - just keep passing the open windows
Just believe - just keep passing the open windows
Do you know how it feels when you don't have a friend
Without a job and no money to spend
You're a stranger
All you think about is suicide
One of these days you're gonna lose the fight
You better keep out of danger - yeah
That same old feeling just keeps burning deep inside
You keep telling yourself it's gonna be the end
Oh get yourself together
Things are looking better everyday
Just believe - just keep passing the open windows
Just believe - just keep passing the open windows.
This is the only life for me
Surround myself around my own fantasy
You just gotta be strong and believe in yourself
Forget all the sadness cause love is all you need.
You just gotta be strong and believe in yourself
Forget all the sadness cause love is all you need.
Love is all you need - baby - love is all you need.
Just believe - just keep passing the open windows.


Here we stand or here we fall
History won't care at all
Make the bed, light the light
Lady Mercy won't be home tonight.
You don't waste no time at all
Don't hear the bell but you answer the call
It comes to you as to us all
We're just waiting for the hammer to fall
Oh every night, and every day
A little piece of you is falling away
But lift your face the Western Way
Build your muscles as your body decays.
Tow the line and play their game
Let the anaesthetic cover it all
Till one day they call your name
You know it's time for the hammer to fall.
Rich or poor or famous for
Your truth it's all the same
(Oh no! Oh no!)
Lock your door but rain is pouring
Through your window pane
(Oh no!)
Baby, now your struggle's all vain.
For we who grew up tall and proud
In the shadow of the Mushroom Cloud
Convinced our voices can't be heard
We just wanna scream it louder and louder and louder
What the hell are we fighting for?
Just surrender and it won't hurt at all
You just got time to say your prayers
While you're waiting for the hammer to—hammer to fall.
Yeah! Yes.
Let's get on the floor!
Yeah! Hammer!
You know
Hammer to fall!
Yeah!
I've been waiting for the hammer to fall!
While you're waiting for the hammer to fall.
Give it to me one more time!


Just think of all those hungry mouths we have to feed
Take a look at all the suffering we breed
So many lonely faces scattered all around
Searching for what they need.
Is this the world we created
What did we do it for
Is this the world we invaded
Against the law
So it seems in the end
Is this what we're all living for today
The world that we created.
You know that everyday a helpless child is born
Who needs some loving care inside a happy home
Somewhere a wealthy man is sitting on his throne
Waiting for life to go by.
Is this the world we created, we made it on our own
Is this the world we devasted, right to the bone
If there's a God in the sky looking down
What can he think of what we've done
To the world that He created.


I took my baby to see a heavy band
But I never saw my baby 'till the encore
She had the singer by the hand
I didn't wanna cry 'cause I had to be cool
I didn't wanna tell you that you're too cruel
Did you have to run off with that dog-gone fool?
All I gotta do is think about you
Ev'ry night and day I go crazy
All I gotta do is get my hands on you
You better stay away from me baby
I wouldn't mind the postman if the neighbours didn't know
Or the gas man the electric man - man to fix the car
I'd have to let it go
But you had to bring me down for a rock 'n roll clone
Leave me like a sucker standing all alone
Did you have to run off with that rolling stone?
All I gotta do is think about you
Ev'ry night and day I go crazy
All I gotta do is get my hands on you
You better stay away from me baby
So I ain't gonna go and see the Rolling Stones no more
no more
I don't wanna go see Queen no more no more
Now I don't wanna hurt you like you been a-hurting me
But you know that I'll be watching
Rolling on the floor next time you're on TV
Had enough of your pretending that you know where it's at
Coming on to all the boys like a real spoilt brat
To think that I nearly let you get away with all that
No way man
All I gotta do is think about you
Ev'ry night and day I go crazy
All I gotta do is get my hands on you


One man, one goal,
One mission.
One heart, one soul,

One voice, one hope,
One real decision.
Wowowowowo, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah!
I had a dream when I was young,
A dream of sweet illusion,
A glimpse of hope and unity,
And visions of one sweet union.
But a cold wind blows,
And a dark rain falls,
And in my heart it shows.
Look what they've done to my dream, yeah.
One vision!
So give me your hands,
Give me your hearts.
I'm ready.
There's only one direction.
One world, one nation,
Yeah, one vision.
No hate, no fight,
Just excitation,
All through the night,
It's a celebration, wowowowo, yeah.

Vision [fading]


It's a kind of magic,
It's a kind of magic,
A kind of magic,
One dream, one soul, one prize,
One goal, one golden glance of what should be,
It's a kind of magic,
One shaft of light that shows the way,
No mortal man can win this day,
It's a mind of magic,
The bell that rings inside your mind,
It's a challenging the doors of time,
It's a kind of magic,
The waiting seems eternity,
The day will dawn of sanity,
It's a kind of magic,
There can be only one,
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be gone,
This flame that burns inside of me,
I'm hearing secret harmonies
It's a kind of magic,
The bell that rings inside your mind,
Is challenging the doors of time,
It's a kind of magic,
It's a kind of magic,
This rage that lasts a thousand years,
Will soon be will soon be,
Will soon be gone,
This is a kind of magic,
There can only be one,
This life that lasts a thousand years,
Will soon be gone,
Magic - it's a kind of magic,
It's a kind of magic,
Magic, magic, magic, magic,
It's magic,
It's a kind of magic.


Just one year of love
Is better than a lifetime alone,
One sentimental moment in your arms
Is like a shooting star right through my heart,
It's always a rainy day without you,
I'm a prisoner of love inside you -
I'm falling apart all around you - yeah.
My heart cries out to your heart,
I'm lonely but you can save me,
My hand reaches out for your hand,
I'm cold but you light the fire in me,
My lips search for your lips,
I'm hungry for your touch,
There's so much left unspoken
And all I can do is surrender
To the moment just surrender
And no one ever told me that love would hurt so much,
Oooh yes it hurts
And pain is so close to pleasure,
And all I can do is surrender to your love,
Just surrender to your love,
Just one year of love,
Is better that a lifetime alone,
One sentimental moment in your arms,
Is like a shooting star right through my heart,
It's always a rainy day without you,
I'm a prisoner of love inside you -
I'm falling apart all around you - yeah.
And all I can do is surrender.


Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure, oh yeah,
Sunshine and rainy weather go hand in hand together all your life,
Ooh, Ooh, pain is so close to pleasure everybody knows,
One day we love each other then we're fighting one another all the time,
When I was young and just getting started,
And people talked to me they sounded broken hearted,
Then I grew up and got my imagination
And all I wanted was to start a new releation,
So in love but love had a bad reaction,
I was looking for good old satisfaction,
But pain is all I got when all I needed was some love and affection,
Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure, yeah, yeah,
Sunshine and rainy weather go hand in hand together all your life,
Pain and pleasure, Ooh, Ooh, pain and pleasure,
When your plans go wrong and you turn out the light,
But inside your mind you have to put up a fight,
Where are the answers that we're all searching for,
There's nothing in this world to be sure of anymore,
But if you're feeling happy someone else is always sad,
Let the sweetness on love wipe the tears from your facem
Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure, I told you so,
Sunshine and rainy weather go hand in hand together all your life,
Pain is so close to pleasure, yeah, yeah,
Sunshine and rainy weather go hand in hand together all your life,
All your life,
Pain - pleasure.

The other half ran away,
Taking all the cash and leaving you with the lumber,
Got a pain in the chest,
Doctors on strike what you need is a rest.

Hold out your hand cos friends will be friends right till the end.
Now it's a beautiful day,
The postman delivered a letter from your lover,
Only a phone call away,
You tried to track him down but somebody stole his number,
As a matter of fact,
You're getting used to life without him in your way.
It's so easy now, cos you got friends you can trust,
Friends will be friends,
When you're in need of love they give you care and attention,

There's no time for us,
There's no place for us,
What is this thing that builds our dreams, yet slips away from us.
Who wants to live forever,
Who wants to live forever.....?
There's no chance for us,
It's all decided for us,
This world has only one sweet moment set aside for us.
Who wants to live forever,
Who dares to love forever,
When love must die.
But touch my tears with your lips,
Touch my world with your fingertips,
And we can have forever,
And we can love forever,
Forever is our today,
Who wants to live forever,
Who wants to live forever,
Forever is our today,
Who waits forever anyway?

We had a good night jamming away,
There was a full moon showing,
And we started to play,
But in the cold light of day next morning
Party was over,
The party was over.
We got love and we got style,
And we got sex and I know we got what it takes oh, oh,
Why don't you come back and play,
Come back and play, come back and play,
We got all night all day,
Everybody's gone away,
Why don't you come back and play, come back and play, come back and play,
Come back and play, Go get 'em boy - let's party,
We had a food fight in somebody's face,
We were up all night singing
And giving a chase,
But in the cold light of day next morning.
Everybody was hung-over.
Come back and play, come back and play,
We got all night all day,
Everybody's gone away,
Why don't you come back and play,
Come back and play,
We got all night and we got all day,
We got all night to play,
Come back, comeback, comeback, comeback, comeback and play,
Goodbye, Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, the party is over.


Who said that my party was all over, huh, huh,
I'm in pretty good shape,
The best years of my life are like a super nova,
Huh, huh, perpetual craze, I said that
Everybody drank my wine -you get my drift,
And then we took a holiday on Khashoggi's ship - well,
We really had a good good time they was all so sexy
We was bad, we was blitzed,
All in all it was a pretty good trip,
This big bad sucker with a fist as big as your head,
Wanted to get me, I said go away
I said kiss my ass honey,
He pulled out a gun, wanted to arrest me,
I said uh, uh, babe,
Now listen no-one stops my party,
No-one stops my party,
No-one, no-one, no-one stops my party,
Just like I said,
We were phased, we was pissed,
Just having a total eclipse,
This one's on me so let us do it just right,
This here one party don't get started 'till midnight,
Party to the left -
Party to the right -
Left - right
No-one stops my .....


Every drop of rain that falls in Sahara Desert says it all,
It's a miracle,
All God's creations great and small, the Golden Gate and the Taj Mahal,
That's a miracle,
Test tube babies being born, mothers, fathers dead and gone,
It's a miracle,
We're having a miracle on earth, mother nature does it all for us,
The wonders of this world go on, the hanging Gardens of Babylon,
Captain Cook and Cain and Able, Jimi Hendrix to the Tower of Babel
It's a miracle, it's a miracle, it's a miracle, it's a miracle,
The one thing we're all waiting for, is peace on earth - an end to war,
It's a miracle we need - the miracle, the miracle we're all waiting for today,
If every leaf on every tree, could tell a story that would be a miracle,
If every child on every street, had clothes to wear and food to eat,
That's a miracle,
If all God's people could be free, to live in perfect harmony,
It's a miracle, we're having a miracle on earth,
Mother nature does it all for us
Open hearts and surgery, Sunday mornings with a cup of tea,
Super powers always fighting,
But Mona Lisa just keeps on smiling,
The wonders of this world go on,
It's a miracle, it's a miracle, it's a miracle, it's a miracle,
The one thing we're all waiting for, is peace on earth and an end to war,
It's a miracle we need, the miracle, the miracle,
Peace on earth and end to war today,
That time will come one day you'll see when we can all be friends,[repeat ...]


Adventure seeker on an empty street,
Just an alley creeper, light on his feet
A young fighter screaming, with no time for doubt
With the pain and anger can't see a way out,
It ain't much I'm asking, I heard him say,
Gotta find me a future move out of my way,
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now,
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now,
Listen all you people, come gather round
I gotta get me a game plan, gotta shake you to the ground
Just give me what I know is mine,
People do you hear me, just give me the sign,
It ain't much I'm asking, if you want the truth
Here's to the future for the dreams of youth,
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now,
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now,
I'm a man with a one track mind,
So much to do in one life time (people do you hear me)
Not a man for compromise and where's and why's and living lies
So I'm living it all, yes I'm living it all,
And I'm giving it all, and I'm giving it all,
It ain't much I'm asking, if you want the truth,
Here's to the future, hear the cry of youth,
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now,
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now,[etc.]


I'm the invisible man,
I'm the invisible man,
Incredible how you can,
See right through me,
When you hear a sound,
That you just can't place
Feel somethin' move
That you just can't trace,
When something sits
On the end of your bed
Don't turn around
When you hear me tread.
I'm the invisible man,
I'm the invisible man
Incredible how you can
See right through me
I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
It's criminal how I can
See right through you.
Now I'm in your room
And I'm in your bed
And I'm in your life
And I'm in your head
Like the CIA
Or the FBI
You'll never get close
Never take me alive
I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
Incredible how you can
See right through me
I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
It's criminal how I can
See right through you,
Hah, hah, hah, hello,
Hah, hah, hah, hello,
Hah, hah, hah, hello-hello-hello-hello,
Never had a real good friend - not a boy or a girl
No-one knows what I've been through - let my flag unfurl
So make my mark from the edge of the world,
From the edge of the world,
From the edge of the world,
Now I'm on your track
And I'm in your mind,
And I'm on your back
But don't look behind
I'm your meanest thought
I'm your darkest fear
Put I'll never get caught
You can't shake me, shake me dear,
I'm the invisible man,
I'm the invisible man
Incredible how you can
See right through me
I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
It's criminal how I can
See right through you
Look at me, look at me


When love breaks up
When the dawn light wakes up
A new life is born
Somehow I have to make this final breakthru . . . Now!
I wake up
Feel just fine,
Your face
Fills my mind
I get religion quick
'Cos you're looking divine
Honey you're touching something, you're touchin' me,
I'm under your thumb, under you're spell, can't you see,
If I could only reach you,
If I could make you smile,
If I could only reach you,
That would really be a breakthru - oh yeah.
Breakthru, these barriers of pain,
Breakthru, to the sunshine from the rain,
Make my feelings known towards you
Turn my heart inside and out for you now
Somehow,
I have to make this final breakthru.
Now!
Your smile,
Speaks books to me,
I break up,
With each and every one of your looks at me,
Honey you're starting something deep inside of me,
Honey you're sparking something, this fire in me,
I'm outta control, I wanna rush headlong into this ecstasy
If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you
That would really be a breakthru
If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile,
If I could only reach you
That would really be a breakthru
Breakthru, breakthru


I can see it in your stars
Life is so exciting,
Acting so bizarre
Your world is so inviting
Playing really cool
And looking so mysterious
Your every day is full of sunshine
But into every life a little rain must fall.
Anyone who imagines
They can blind you with science
Bully you all over
With property and finance
But you have position
To call the shots and name the price
You found success and recognition
But into every life a little rain must fall
You lead a fairy tale existence
But into every life a little rain must fall
Others seem to think
You are over dramatising
Problems at work
So it's hardly surprising
There's little you can do
To alter their opinions
You want a clean reputation
But now you're facing complications
'Cos into every life a little rain must fall


Scandal - now you've left me all the world's gonna know
Scandal, they're gonna turn our lives into a freak show,
They'll see the heart-ache, they'll see our love break,
They'll hear me pleading, I'll say for Gods sake,
Over and over and over again,
Scandal - now you've left me there's no healing the wounds,
Hey scandal, and all the world can make us out to be fools,
Here come the bad news, open the floodgates
They'll leave us bleeding, we say you cheapskates,
Over and over and over again,
So let them know when they stare, it's just a private affair,
They'll have us hung in the air and tell me what do they care,
It's only a life to be twisted and broken,
They'll see the heart-ache, they'll see our love break - yeah,
They'll hear me pleading, I'll say for Gods sake,
Over and over and over and over again,
Scandal, scandal,
Scandal, yes you're breaking my heart again,
Today the headlines, tomorrow hard times,
And no-one really knows the truth from the lies,
And in the end the story deeper must hide,
Deeper and deeper and deeper inside,
Scandal, scandal [etc.]


My baby
Baby does
My baby does, me good
My baby does
May baby does me
My baby does me good
My lady
Understands
Understands me, right
She understands me
She understands me
Understands me right
My baby cares
She really cares
She knows what's really right for me
Does me good then she hurts me so
She winds me up then lets me go
Turns me on and then tells me no
She's just a pussy cat
My baby loves me
My baby loves me
My baby cuffs me
One day she tells me that she cares
Another day she tells me she don't love me
She really really does me


What is there left for me to do in this life.
Did I achieve what I had set in my sights.
Am I a happy man, or is this sinking sand,
Was it all worth it, was it all worth it.
Yeah, now hear my story, let me tell you about it,
We bought a drum kit. blew my own trumpet.
Played the circuit, thought we were perfect,
Was it all worth it. giving all my heart and soul and
Staying up all night, was it all worth it,
Living breathing rock n'roll, a godforsaken life,
Was it all worth it, was it all worth it all these years.
Put down our money without counting the cost,
It didn't matter if we won - if we lost,
Yes we were vicious. yes we could kill,
Yes we were hungry. yes we were brill,
We served a purpose, like a bloody circus,
We were so dandy we love you madly,
Was it all worth it. was it all worth it,
Living breathing rock n'roll, this godforsaken life,
Was it all worth it. was it all worth it,
When the hurly burly's done -
We went to Bali, saw God and Dali.
So mystic, surrealistic,
Was it all worth it, giving all my heart and soul,
Staying up all night, was it all worth it,
Living breathing rock n'roll this never ending fight,
Was it all worth it, was it all worth it,
Yes, it was a worthwhile experience,
It was worth it.


Don't let go, don't lose your mystique,
Wait a little longer,
Tomorrow brings another feast,
Don't let go, don't lose your reputation,
Thank god you're still alive,
You're still in one piece,
Hang on in there, don't lose your appetite,
Hang on in there, forget the danger signs,
Fray for that magical moment and it will appear
(Don't fight for lost emotions,)
Wait for the sunrise,
And everything will seem so clear,
(Look straight ahead, look straight ahead,)
Hang on in there, hang on in there, hang on in there,
Your wish will be granted,
All your problems will disappear,
Don't be a fool, you haven't reached your peak,
You got a fast car racing up inside you,
Your life is incomplete,
Hang on in there, hang on in there,
Fray for that magical moment and it will appear
(Wait for that moment),
Wait for the sunrise,
Just wait and see and it will seem so clear,
Let's go, let's go - OK now do the change now,
Yeah, hang on in there,
Hang on in there [etc.]


Just walking down the street
One cloudless sunny day
Just minding my business
Thinking my thoughts - nothing much to say
When suddenly I got hit
Imagine my surprise
Your smile came up and zapped me
Right between the eyes
I'd never seen anything to compare
With your smile
I'd never seen anything
That came within miles
My heart got hijacked by you
Stuck in the traffic
Stuck at the lights
What do I see
Some stupid bimbo
In a fast car next to me
She takes off
Imagine my disgust
Like a bat outta hell
I get to eat her dust
I never known anything to compare
With her laugh
I never known anything
That counted by half
My heart got hijacked by you
Hijack my heart
Hijack my heart
Steal my heart
Hijack my heart
Hijack my heart
Look at the city
Look at the streets
What do you see?
Look at the faces
Look at the people
They all wonder me
Suddenly hit by something
They don't get to choose
It comes out of nowhere
Right out of the blue
'Cos I've never seen anything
To compare with your smile
I've never seen anything
That came within miles
My heart got hijacked by you
Hijack my heart
Now you really got a hold on me
You hijacked my heart
Don't you never let me be
Stole my heart
Threw away the key
Ooh ee, baby what's become of me
You hijacked my heart
Now you really got a hold on me
You hijacked my heart
Don't you never let me be


That's the way I am
Does anybody want to know?
This is the way I lead my life, you know
Wheelin' and dealin' and a little bit of stealin'
You know, that's the way I grew up
It's the only life I know
That's the way my mother told me
And they go
Stealin'
I gave you the key to my home
I left you alone
In charge of my heart
Hey, stealin'
You got me wheelin' and dealin'
Playin' with my feelin'
Right from the start
Can't afford to pay my rent
I had to use my common sense
To get some money I owe, uh oh
This guy said look in my head
Make some easy bread
Stealin' is the only way that I know oh
Stealin' hey
Only way that I know
Yeah that I'm stealin' baby stealin'
I gave you board and my own and my own
Left you alone
Now you're stealin' stealin' stealin'
Of my heart
You're my baby's heart
Uh huh eeeee
Baby let it bleed
You're in charge of my heart
You are in charge of my heart
You are in charge of
You are in charge
Ba la ba la dap
Ba la da da da dap
Ba da da da da
Because you are in charge of my heart
I gave you the key
And told of the man

Looked down on what I said
What have I done?
What have I done?
Yes I have got to bleed
On, on and on
Got to bleed on
On and on
Yes got my heart
Ha ha uh uh uh uh
Wooh


While the sun hangs in the sky and the desert has sand
While the waves crash in the sea and meet the land
While there's a wind and the stars and the rainbow
Till the mountains crumble into the plain
Oh yes we'll keep on tryin'
Tread that fine line
Oh we'll keep on tryin' yeah
Just passing our time
While we live according to race, color or creed
While we rule by blind madness and pure greed
Our lives dictated by tradition, superstition, false religion
Through the eons, and on and on
Oh yes we'll keep on tryin'
We'll tread that fine line
Oh we'll keep on tryin'
Till the end of time
Till the end of time
Through the sorrow all through our splendor
Don't take offence at my innuendo
You can be anything you want to be
Just turn yourself into anything you think that you could ever be
Be free with your tempo, be free be free
Surrender your ego - be free, be free to yourself
Oooh, ooh -
If there's a God or any kind of justice under the sky
If there's a point, if there's a reason to live or die
If there's an answer to the questions we feel bound to ask
Show yourself - destroy our fears - release your mask
Oh yes we'll keep on trying
Hey tread that fine line
Yeah we'll keep on smiling yeah
And whatever will be - will be
We'll just keep on trying
We'll just keep on trying
Till the end of time
Till the end of time
Till the end of time


When the outside temperature rises
And the meaning is oh so clear
One thousand and one yellow daffodils
Begin to dance in front of you - oh dear
Are they trying to tell you something?
You're missing that one final screw
You're simply not in the pink my dear
To be honest you haven't got a clue
I'm going slightly mad
I'm going slightly mad
It finally happened - happened
It finally happened - ooh oh
It finally happened - I'm slightly mad
Oh dear!
I'm one card short of a full deck
I'm not quite the shilling
One wave short of a shipwreck
I'm not at my usual top billing
I'm coming down with a fever
I'm really out to sea
This kettle is boiling over
I think I'm a banana tree
Oh dear, I'm going slightly mad
I'm going slightly mad
It finally happened, happened
It finally happened uh huh
It finally happened I'm slightly mad - oh dear!
I'm knitting with only one needle
Unravelling fast its true
I'm driving only three wheels these days
But my dear how about you?
I'm going slightly mad
I'm going slightly mad
It finally happened
It finally happened oh yes
It finally happened
I'm slightly mad!
Just very slightly mad!
And there you have it!


And you're rushing headlong you've got a new goal
And you're rushing headlong out of control
And you think you're so strong
But there ain't no stopping no there's nothin'
You can do about it
There's nothin' you can do
No there's nothin' you can do about it
No there's nothin' you can, nothin' you can
Nothin' you can do about it
And you're rushing headlong you've got a new goal
And you're rushing headlong out of control
And you think you're so strong
But there ain't no stopping no there's nothin'
You can do about it
He used to be a man with a stick in his hand
Hoop diddy diddy - Hoop diddy do
She used to be a woman with a hot dog stand
Hoop diddy diddy - Hoop diddy do
Now you've got soup in the laundry bag
Now you've got strings, you're gonna lose your rag
You're gettin' in a fight
Then it ain't so groovy when you're screaming in the night
Let me out of this cheap `B' movie
Headlong down the highway and you're rushing
Headlong out of control
And you think you're so strong
But there ain't no stopping and you can't stop rockin'
And there's nothin' you can, nothin' you can
Nothin' you can do about it
When a red hot man meets a white hot lady
Hoop diddy diddy - Hoop diddy do
Soon the fire starts a raging gets 'em more than half crazy
They start freaking everyway you turn
You can't start walking cause your feet got burned
It ain't no time to figure wrong from right
Cause reason's out the window
Better hold on tight - you're rushin'... [etc.]


I can't live with you
But I can't live without you -
I can't let you stay
But I can't live if you go away
I don't know just how it goes
All I know is I can't live with you
I'm having a hard time
I'm walking a fine line
Between hope and despair
You may think that I don't care -
But I traveled a long road to
Get a hold of my sorrow
I tried to catch a dream
But nothing's what it seems
Love is saying baby it's all right
When deep inside you're really petrified
Lover turns to hater
On this escalator
I can't live with you
But I can't live without you
I can't breathe - if you stay
But I can't bear you to go away
I don't know what time it is
All I know is I can't live with you
We're stuck in a bad place
We're trapped in a rat race
And we can't escape
Maybe there's been some mistake
We're trying to make a high score
We're walking through a closed door
And nobody's winning -
We're just sinning against ourselves
Hold on baby tell me it's all right
Anger's breaking from the hurt inside
Passions screaming hotter
Doin' what we gotta do - yeah
I can't live with you, I can't live with you
I can't live, I can't live
I can't, I can't live with you
But baby I'll never ever leave you
I can't live with you
But I can't live without you -
Cause I'm in love with you
And everything about you
I can't live with you
No I just can't live, I just can't live,
I can't live with you,
And I can't live without you
Through the madness, through the tears
We've still got each other
For a million years


If you're searching out for something -
Don't try so hard
If you're feeling kinda nothing -
Don't try so hard
When your problems seem like mountains
You feel the need to find some answers
You can leave them for another day
Don't try so hard
But if you fall and take a tumble -
It won't be far
If you fail you mustn't grumble -
Thank your lucky stars
Just savour every mouthful
And treasure every moment
When the storms are raging round you
Stay right where you are
Don't try so hard
Oooh don't take it all to heart
It's only fools they make these rules
Don't try so hard
One day you'll be a sergeant major
Oh you'll be so proud
Screaming out your bloody orders
Hey but not too loud
Polish all your shiny buttons
Dressed as lamb instead of mutton
But you never had to try
To stand out from the crowd
Oh what a beautiful world
Is this the life for me
Oh what a beautiful world
It's the simple life for me
Oh don't try so hard
Oh don't take it all to heart
It's only fools - they make these rules
Don't try so hard
Don't try so hard


Ride the wild wind
(Push the envelope don't sit on the fence)
Ride the wild wind
(Live life on the razors edge)
Gonna ride the whirlwind
It ain't dangerous - enough for me
Get your head down baby - we're gonna ride tonight
Your angel eyes are shining bright
I wanna take your hand - lead you from this place
Gonna leave it all behind
Check out of this rat race -
Ride the wild wind
Ride the wild wind
Gonna ride the whirlwind -
It ain't dangerous - enough for me
Tie your hair back baby -
We're gonna ride tonight
We got freaks to the left - we got jerks to the right
Sometimes I get so low - I just have to ride
Let me take your hand
Let me be your guide
Ride the wild wind
(Don't sit on the fence)
Ride the wild wind
(Live life on the razors edge)
Gonna ride the whirlwind
It ain't dangerous - enough for me
Ride the wild wind


So all you people give freely
Make welcome inside your homes
Thank God you people give freely
Don't turn your back on the lesson of the Lord
All prime ministers and majesty around the world
Open your eyes look, touch and feel
Rule with your heart, live with your conscience
Love, love,
Love, love and be free
We're all God's people
Gotta face up
Better grow up
Gotta stand tall and be strong
Gotta face up
Better grow up
Gotta stand tall and be strong
Gotta face up

Then I, then I, then I went into a dream
Rule with your heart and live with your conscience

Make welcome inside your homes
Let us be thankful, he's so incredible
We're all God's people

We're all God's people

Sometimes I get to feelin'
I was back in the old days - long ago
When we were kids, when we were young
Things seemed so perfect - you know?
The days were endless, we were crazy - we were young
The sun was always shinin' - we just lived for fun
Sometimes it seems like lately - I just don't know
The rest of my life's been - just a show.
Those were the days of our lives
The bad things in life were so few
Those days are all gone now but one thing is true -
When I look and I find I still love you.
You can't turn back the clock, you can't turn back the tide
Ain't that a shame?
I'd like to go back one time on a roller coaster ride
When life was just a game
No use sitting and thinkin' on what you did
When you can lay back and enjoy it through your kids
Sometimes it seems like lately I just don't know
Better sit back and go - with the flow
Cos these are the days of our lives
They've flown in the swiftness of time
These days are all gone now but some things remain
When I look and I find - no change
Those were the days of our lives yeah
The bad things in life were so few
Those days are all gone now but one thing's still true
When I look and I find, I still love you,
I still love you.


Delilah, Delilah, oh my, oh my, oh my - you're irresistible
You make me smile when I'm just about to cry
You bring me hope, you make me laugh - you like it
You get away with murder, so innocent
But when you throw a moody you're all claws and you bite -
That's alright!
Delilah, Delilah, oh my, oh my, oh my - you're unpredictable
You make me so very happy
When you cuddle up and go to sleep beside me
And then you make me slightly mad
When you pee all over my Chippendale Suite
Delilah, Delilah,
Hey - Hey - Hey,
You take over my house and home
You even try to answer my telephone
Delilah, you're the apple of my eyes
Meeow, Meeow, Meeow,
Delilah - I love you
Oh you make me so very happy - you give me kisses
And I go out of my mind ooh,
Meeow, Meeow, Meeow, Meeow,
You're irresistible - I love you Delilah
Delilah - I love you
Oooh - I love your kisses
Oooh - I love your kisses...


I'm the hitman
Stand aside
I'm the hitman
I want your life
Ain't no escaping
Don't run and hide
There goes the neighbourhood
I'm gonna kill for your love
Hitman
Now don't you cry
I'm just it man
And you might get fried
Gun in my pocket

I'll be your hitman - a fool for your love
I'm the head shredder -
That's better -
Baby baby baby
I'm a hitman - hitman - hitman
Yeah - trouble in the East, troubled in the West
Struggle with the beast - what a thief, what a pest
Come back mother / Nuke that sucker
Yeah - yeah - yeah
I'm the hitman - that's the way to do it
I'm your prize
But this hitman -
Can cut you down to size
Love me (baby)
Don't be so cool
Love me love me baby
I've been to the hitman school
Yeah - yeah
You're gonna make my day
Gonna blow you away
Now the fun begins
Hitman
Are you ready for the sting
Gonna waste that thing
Hitman is king


You and me are destined
You'll agree
To spend the rest of our lives with each other
The rest of our days like two lovers
For ever - yeah - for ever
My bijou...


Empty spaces - what are we living for
Abandoned places - I guess we know the score
On and on, does anybody know what we are looking for...
Another hero, another mindless crime
Behind the curtain, in the pantomime
Hold the line, does anybody want to take it anymore
The show must go on,
The show must go on
Inside my heart is breaking
My make-up may be flaking
But my smile still stays on.
Whatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance
Another heartache, another failed romance
On and on, does anybody know what we are living for?
I guess I'm learning, I must be warmer now
I'll soon be turning, round the corner now
Outside the dawn is breaking
But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free
The show must go on
The show must go on
Inside my heart is breaking
My make-up may be flaking
But my smile still stays on
My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies
Fairytales of yesterday will grow but never die
I can fly - my friends
The show must go on
The show must go on
I'll face it with a grin
I'm never giving in
On - with the show -
I'll top the bill, I'll overkill
I have to find the will to carry on
On with the -
On with the show -
The show must go on...


It's a beautiful day
The sun is shining
I feel good
And no-one's gonna stop me now, oh yeah
It's a beautiful day
I fell good, I fell right
And no-one, no-one's gonna stop me now
Mama
Sometimes I fell so sad, so sad, so bad
But no-one's gonna stop me now, no-one
It's hopeless - so hopeless to even try


I'm taking my ride with destiny
Willing to play my part
Living with painful memories
Loving with all my heart
Made in heaven, made in heaven
It was all ment to be, yeah
Made in heaven, made in heaven
That's what they say
Can't you see
Oh I know, I know, I know that it's true
Yes it's really ment to be
Deep in my heart
I'm having to learn to pay the price
They're turning me upside down
Waiting for possibilities
Don't see too many around
Made in heaven, made in heaven
It's for all to see
Made in heaven, made in heaven
That's what everybody says
Everybody says to me
It was really ment to be
Yeah, yeah
When stormy weather comes around
It was made in heaven
When sunny skies break through behin the clouds
I wish it could last forever, yeah
Wish it could last forever, forever
I'm playing my role in history
Looking to find my goal
Taking in all this misery
But giving in all my soul
Made in heaven, made in heaven
It was all ment to be, yeah
Made in heaven, made in heaven
That's what everybody says
Wait and see, it was really ment to be
So plain to see
Yeah, everybody, everybody, everybody tells me so
Yes it was plain to see, yes it was ment to be
Written in the stars...
Written in the stars...


Why don't you take another little piece of my heart
Why don't you take it and break it
And tear it all apart
All I do is give
All you do is take
Baby why don't you give me
A brand new start
So let me live (so let me live)
Let me live (leave me alone)
Let me live, oh baby
And make a brand new start
Why don't you take another little piece of my soul
Why don't you shape it and shake it
'Til you're really in control
All you do is take
And all I do is give
All that I'm asking
Is a chance to live
(So let me live) - so let me live
(Leave me alone) - let me live, let me live
Why don't you let me make a brand new start
And it's a long hard struggle
But you can always depend on me
And if you're ever in trouble - hey
You know where I will be
Why don't you take another little piece of my life
Why don't you twist it, and turn it
And cut it like a knife
All you do is live
All I do is die
Why can't we just be friends
Stop living a lie
So let me live (so let me live)
Let me live (leave me alone)
Please let me live
(Why don't you live a little)
Oh yeah baby
(Why don't you give a little love...?)
Let me live
Please let me live
Oh yeah baby, let me live
And make a brand new start
Take a little piece of my heart now baby
Take a little piece of my heart now baby
Take a little piece of my soul now baby
Take a little piece of my life now baby
In your heart, oh baby
(Take another piece, take another piece)
Please let me live
(Take another piece, take another piece)
Why don't you take another piece
Take another little piece of my heart
Oh yeah baby
Make a brand new start
All you do is take
Let me live


I don't want to sleep with you
I don't need the passion too
I don't want a stormy affair
To make me feel my life is heading somewhere
All I want is the comfort and care
Just to know that my woman gives me sweet -
Mother love
I've walked too long in this lonely lane
I've had enough of this same old game
I'm a man of the world and they say I'm strong
But my heart is heavy and my hope is gone
Out in the city, in the cold world outside
I don't want pity, just safe place to hide
Mama please, let me back inside
< I don't want to make no waves
But you can give me all the love that I crave
I can't take if you see me cry
I long for peace before I die
All I want to know that you're there
You're gonna give me all your sweet -
Mother love
My body's aching, but I can't sleep
My dreams are all the company I keep
Got such a feeling as the sun goes down
I'm coming home to my sweet -
Mother love


This is where we are today
People going separate ways
This is the way things are now
In dissaray
I read it in the papers
There's death on every page
Oh Lord, I thank the Lord above
My life has been saved
Here we go, telling lies
Here we go
We're right back where we started from
People going separate ways
This is the way things are now
In dissaray
I read it in the papers
There's death on every page
Oh Lord, I thank you from above
My life has been saved
My life, my life has been saved
My life, my life, my life has been saved


I was born to love you
With every single beat of my heart
Yes, I was born to take care of you
Every single day...[chorus:]
I was born to love you
With every single beat of my heart
Yes, I was born to take care of you
Every single day of my life
You are the one for me
I am the man for you
You were made for me
You're my ecstasy
If I was given every opportunity
I'd kill for your love
So take a chance with me
Let me romance with you
I'm caught in a dream
And my dream's come true
It's so hard to believe
This is happening to me
An amazing feeling
Comin' through[chorus]
I wanna love you
I love every little thing about you
I wanna love you, love you, love you
Born - to love you
Born - to love you
Yes I was born to love you
Born - to love you
Born - to love you
Every single day - of my life
An amazing feeling
Coming through[chorus]
Yes I was born to love you
Every single day of my life
Go, I love you babe
Yes I was born to love you
I wanna love you, love you, love you
I wanna love you
I get so lonely, lonely, lonely
Yeah, I want to love you
Yeah, give it to me


This could be heaven
This could be heaven
This could be heaven for everyone
In these days of cool reflection
You come to me and everything seems alright
In these days of cold affections
You sit by me and everything's fine
This could be heaven for everyone
This world could be fed, this world could be fun
This could be heaven for everyone
This world could be free, this world could be one
In this world of cool deception
Just your smile can smoth my ride
These troubled days of cruel rejection, hmm
You come to me, soothe my troubled mind
Yeah, this could be heaven for everyone
This world could be fed, this world could be fun
This should be love for everyone, yeah
This world should be free, this world could be one
We should bring love to our daughters and sons
Love, love, love, this could be heaven for everyone
You know that
This could be heaven for everyone
This could be heaven for everyone
Listen - what people do to other souls
They take their lives - destroy their goals
Their basic pride and dignity
Is stripped and torn and shown no pity
When this should be heaven for everyone


I'm just the pieces of the man I used to be
Too many bitter tears are raining down on me
I'm far away from home
And I've been facing this alone
For much too long
I feel like no one ever told the truth to me
About growing up and what a struggle it would be
In my tangled state of mind
I've been looking back to find
Where I went wrong
Too much love will kill you
If you can't make up your mind
Torn between the lover and the love you leave behind
You're headed for disaster 'cos you never read the signs
Too much love will kill you every time
I'm just the shadow of the man I used to be
And it seems like there's no way out of this for me
I used to bring you sunshine
Now all I ever do is bring you down
How would it be if you were standing in my shoes
Can't you see that it's impossible to choose?
No, there's no making sense of it
Every way I go I'm bound to lose
Too much love will kill you
Just as sure as none at all.
It'll drain the power that's in you
Make you plead and scream and crawl
And the pain will make you crazy
You're the victim of your crime
Too much love will kill you every time
Too much love will kill you
It'll make your life a lie
Yes, too much love will kill you
And you won't understand why
You'd give your life, you'd sell your soul
But here it comes again
Too much love will kill you
In the end...
In the end.


You don't fool me
You don't fool me...
Da, da da da dah
Da da da dah
Da da dah...
You don't fool me - those pretty eyes
That sexy smile - you don't fool me
You don't rule me - you're no surprize
You're telling lies - you don't fool me
Mmm, mama said be careful of that girl
Mama said you know that she's no good
Mama said be cool, don't you be no fool
Yup bup ba ba ba ba da da da dah!
You don't fool me
You don't fool me, you don't fool me
She'll take you
You don't fool me, and break you
You don't rule me, you don't fool me
You don't fool me, she'll take you
You don't fool me, and break you
Sooner or later you'll be playing by her rules
Baby you don't fool me, yeah
You don't fool me, you don't have to say 'don't mind'
You don't have to teach me things I know
Sooner or later you'll be playing by her rules
Oh, (fool you) oh, (rule you) she'll take you (take you)
And break you (break you)
Yeah
Mama said be cool
Mama said she'll take you for a fool
She'll take you, and break you
Ba ba ba ba bap bap ba baah
La la la la la lah
You don't fool me
You don't fool me...


It's winter-fall
Red skies are gleaming - oh -
Sea gulls are flying over
Swans are floatin' by
Smoking chimney-tops
Am I dreaming
Am I dreaming ...?
The nights draw in
There's silky moon up in the sky - yeah -
Children are fantisising
Grown-ups are standin' by
What a super feeling
Am I dreaming
Am I dreaming ...?
woh-woh-woh-woh
(draming)
So quiet and peaceful
Tranquil and blissful
There's a kind of magic in the air
What a truly magnificent view
A breathtaking scene
With the dreams of the world
In the palm of your hand
(draming)
A cosy fireside chat
A little this, a little that
Sound of merry laughter skippin' by
Gentle rain beatin' on my face
What an extraordinary place!
And the dream of the child
Is the hope of the man
It's all so beautiful
Like a landscape painting in the sky - yeah -
Mountains are zoomin' higher - mm -
Little girls scream an' cry
My world is spinnin' and spinnin' and spinnin'
It's unbelievable
Sends me reeling
Am I dreaming...
Am I dreaming...?
Oooh - it' a bliss.


It's a beautiful day
The sun is shining
I feel good
And no-one's gonna stop me now, oh yeah
It's a beautiful day
I fell good, I fell right
And no-one, no-one's gonna stop me now
Mama
Sometimes I fell so sad, so sad, so bad
But no-one's gonna stop me now, no-one
It's hopeless - so hopeless to even try


What planet is this, mmmh? 
Let there be rock'n'roll 
It's a Saturday night and I'm home alone 
With the music on quiet I'm flying solo 
Then my feet start moving to the sound of the beat 
Put the music up loud hear it in the street 
Then the neighbours start banging on my front door 
Throw the door wide open saying what's your point 
Come on in let's rock this joint 
We got the whole house rocking 
We got the whole house rocking 
We got the whole house rocking 
We got the whole house rocking 
We got the whole house rocking 
To the mighty power of rock 'n' roll 
We dance out of the door, dance into the street 
And all the people are swaying to the musical beat 
We rock down the road and down to the town 
And all the people stare and smile and get down 
Then the police man is saying "stop this noise"
But the beat takes over now he's one of the boys 
The beat's taken over now he's one of the boys

With the sun in your eyes and the wind in your face
To heaven you rise in a holy embrace
Your feet on the round your head in the clouds
And you're wondering if you're never coming down
In an istant the mysteries of life will unfold
The myths and the dragons of time will explode
Here's to a real understanding of truth
For compassion and grace to be given their chance too
Raise up your mind
It's time to shine
A moment down through millennium
Unveiling the secrets of song to be sung
Waters of life flowing soft to the touch
Wisdom remembered have we forgotten oh so much
Raise up your mind
It's time to shine
Raise up your mind
Hey, it's time to shine
Let's awaken from barbarity
Into a world of serenity
Beyond the rage of foolish pride
And on to the golden shores of paradise
Raise up your mind
Hey, it's time to shine
Raise up your mind
Hey, it's time to shine
Raise up your mind
Your time to shine
It's time to shine
It's time to shine:


I can't wake in the mornin'
I can't sleep at night
I got a pain in my memory
That just won't sit right
You might say I'm losing my mind
What a shame, shame, shame
But I don't want and I don't need
To play the cryin' game
Music lights this flame in me
I won't let it go and it won't let me be
I'm just a happy slave and oh I can't leave it
'Cause I'm still, and I always will - be a believer
Still burnin' (yeah)
Still yearnin' (and the wheel's)
Still turnin' (ooh let me tell you why)
We're jivin' (and the beat's)
Still drivin' (and we are all)
Sky divin' (rock 'n' roll never die)
I can't breathe in the city
Got dust in my lungs
I get mad in the country
Everythin' seem to go wrong
You might think I'm playin' around
But my heart is true
I got reason to believe
That sweet soul magic
Gonna tear my heart in two
Music makes the world go round
I've been flyin' on the wings of the sound
It feels so good from way up here
I'm still a believer
Headin' for the stars
Oh yeah
Still burnin', still yearnin'
Still burnin'
Still yearnin'
Still turnin' (better than every guy)
We're jivin'
Still drivin'
Sky divin' (rock 'n' roll never die)
Don't say that you love me I can't go that road
But don't think for a moment that my heart went cold
I keep thinkin' about what I lost
And what I might have found
I went to sleep and when I woke
Everything had turned around
Still burnin' (yeah)
Still yearnin'
Still turnin' (a new day dawnin')
We're jivin'
Still drivin'
Sky divin' (early in the morning)
Still burnin' (yeah)
Still yearnin' (and the wheel's)
Still turnin' (better than every guy)
We're jivin' (and the beat's)
Still drivin' (and we're all)
Sky divin' (rock 'n' roll never die)


I like to sit here in the sunshine
The trees in the fields are green sublime
Suspended in time
And don't it make you feel small?
I like to sit here by the fire's light
The trees in the fields lie bare to the night
The stars burn bright
And don't it make you feel small?
Everyone needs a place they can hide
Hide away find a space to be alone
Everyone needs a place they can hide
Everyone needs to find peace sublime
I like to sit here in the Autumn time
The trees in the fields they rustle in the wind
The church bells gently chime
Gentle on your mind
Suspendend in time
And don't it make you feel small?
Everyone needs a place they can hide
Everyone needs to find peace sublime
Oh peace of mind
Everyone needs a place they can hide
Hide away find a space to be alone
Everyone needs a place they can hide
Hide away find a space to be alone
Everyone needs a place they can hide
Hide away find a space to be alone
Everyone needs a place they can hide
Everyone needs to find - peace sublime
Oh peace of mind


They were born with the knowledge of the struggle to survive 
They were raised, learning only ways to stay alive 
Their language is the language of the bullet and the gun 
If you can see them coming, baby better run 
Here come the warboys 
Here come the warboys 
Well they look so pretty as they march and drill 
It's such, a pity that they're dressed to kill 
Soldiers marching two by two 
When it all comes down they know exactly what to do 
Here come the... war 
Warboys, warboys, children and their toys 
Warboys, warboys, make lot a noise 
Warboys, when the lightning exlpodes 
I pray for your soul 
Hup...2...3...4 
Well they look so fierce they're gonna tear out your heart 
When they get near we're gonna see what they got 
Hold on to your soul, friend of mine 
I'll see you in hell, some other time 
Here come the boys 
Helping to kill, those who deserve to die 
Tell me who decides 
You and I 
We have the power


I believe there's no evil out there we didn't have a hand in 
You believe it's a time for peace and a time for understanding 
Some of us believe that we are chosen 
And if God is on our side we'll win the game 
And some of us believe that there's a heaven 
When the trumpets sound and the judges call your name 
But let's get it straight: 
I believe there's just once chance in this world to hear our brothers 
You believe there's a better way to listen to each other 
We don't get what the other guy is saying 
We hear the words but we don't understand 
So around the world the same old anger raging 
And we all cry for shame and the same old tragedy goes down 
We believe there's a better way to fight 
There's a way to make our children safe at night 
We believe there's a war we could be winning 
But the only way to win it is to give what we need to receive 
I believe we need a hero to step boldly from the shadows 
You believe there must be someone on the scene that fits the bill 
A man or a woman who knows how to say I'm sorry 
With courage in his heart to match his creed 
A leader who can build a brand new morning 
And match the tide of changes 
Match the intent with the deed 
We believe there's a deed of obligation 
To bring reconciliation 
To make peace with every nation - in our time 
We believe there's not a minute we should be wasting 
When the darkness falls it's too late to fix the crime 
It's peace that we need 
Every father every mother knows the meaning 
Human treasure that our leaders do forget 
And the bullets fly in the face of common reason 
And the pain we give is the legacy in the end we get 
We believe there's a song that's worth the singing 
It's a song of truth we're bringing 
There's a way to share the Earth with everyone 
We believe every creature has a being 
Has a right to respect and feeling 
To live and breathe and flourish in the sun 
That's what we believe

Call me if you need my love
Call me if you need my love
Call me if you need my love

Apartment in the heart of town

My house is tumbling down (ooh ooh)
Call me if you need my love

One look was all I took, yeah

Call me if you need my love (oh, babe)

When the moons rises
The dogs will howl
Look out of your window
I'll be on the prowl
I'm not usually
A gambling man
But oh I just wanna
Hold up my hands
And say I'm
Taking a chance on you love
Woah I'm taking a chance on you love
I'm not superstitious
And I don't wear no charm
I don't carry my heart on the sleeve of my arm
Seven years of bad luck
Please don't worry me
'Cause when I look in the mirror
Here's the future I see
I'm taking a chance on you love
Woah, I'm taking a chance on you love
Place your bets, Better yet
Don't forget, What I said
Roll the dice, Spin the wheel
Always remember, You've got to keep it real
Don't believe in voodoo
Black magic was never my style
But I believe you do
And it won't take much time
To gather the portions
That weave your magic spell
The moon on the ocean
Has a secret to tell
But anyway I'm
Taking a chance on you love
Woah I'm taking a chance on you love
Woah I'm taking a chance on you love


Once I loved a butterfly
Don't wonder how, don't ask me why
But I believed what I'd been told
'All things that glitter can't be gold'
Ooooo ooo yeah
All things that glitter can't be gold
Those jealous minds conspired to say
Just let that creature fly away
How can it be she has it all
Her pride is headed for a fall
Ooooo ooo yeah
All things that glitter can't be gold
Oh Lord, what races we run
Seeking our place in the Sun
Reaching and doping we'll find the right one
Now every day a new joy brings
My butterfly grew golden wings
It seems we find as we grow old
Some things that glitter may be gold
Ooooo ooo yeah
Some things that glitter may be gold 
So let us mind what's there to see
Before our hearts become too cold
In spite of all that we've been told
Some things that glitter may be gold
Ooooo ooo yeah
Some things that glitter may be gold
Ooooo ooo yeah
Some things that glitter
May be gold


Oh yeah
Ain't got no hope, got no idea
What to do or why I'm here
I wanna get my face on your T.V.
I wanna be heard
I want to be seen
I ain't got nothing, no, nothing
Nothing to show
(Make me a celebrity!)
I want to be
A face on T.V.
(I wanna be on your screen)
Then you can see
I'm a C-lebrity
I wanna get my features in magazines
See this creature on every street on every screen
Write my life story before I'm twenty-one
I've gotta tell the world
They may say I'm dumb - but er
Ain't got nothing, no nothing
Nothing to show
(Make me a celebrity!)
I want to be
A face on T.V.
(I wanna be on your screen)
Then you can see
I'm a C-lebrity
(Yeah!)
I want to be a star in a Broadway musical
They're gonna love me, I can't sing or dance at all
Some may say I'm lackadaisical and if I was real good
I'd stand no chance at all - but I
I want to be
A face on T.V.
(yeah, I wanna be on your screen)
Then you can see
I'm a C-lebrity
(Then you can say)
Then you can say
You knew me one day
(And then you will see)
Then you will see
I'm a C-lebrity
(Oh oh oh)
C, c-lebrity
Wanna be a c-c-c-lebrity
(Make my dream come true)
C, c-lebrity
Wanna be a c-c-c-c-lebrity
I want to be heard
I want to be seen on every T.V. screen
Yeh


Tell me something that'll ease my pain
I am living life in vain
Crying doesn't help me any more
Tell me something that'll ease my mind
I am walking the line
Trying doesn't get my anywhere
I wander through the night
All the stars are shining bright
Searching for a guiding light
I wander through the night
Tell me something 'cause I need to know
Can you teach me how to live
How to understand how to love and how to give
Anger burns in bitterness and fills me up inside
I can't face it and there's no place I can hide
I wander through the night
All the stars are shining bright
Searching for a guiding light
I wander through the night
Tell me something 'cause I need to know
Can you teach me how to live
How to understand how to love and how to give
Anger burns in bitterness and fills me up inside
Without your love there's nowhere I can hide
I wander through the night
All the stars are shining bright
Earching for a guding light
I wander through the night


The harder we play 
The faster we fall 
When we think that we know it all 
We know nothing at all 
The letter arrives 
Like a bolt from the blue 
So what's left of your lives 
All your dreams lost to you 
Say it ain't true 
Say it today 
When I open my eyes 
Will it all go away 
Say it's not true 
Say it's not real 
Can't be happening to you 
Can't be happening to me 
It's hard not to cry 
It's hard to believe 
So much heartache and pain 
So much reason to grieve 
With the wonders of science 
All the knowledge we've stored 
Magic cocktails for lives 
People just can't afford 
Say it's not true 
You can say it's not right 
It's hard to believe 
The size of the crime 
Say it's not true 
You can say it's not right 
So hard to believe 
The size of the crime 
Say... 
Say it's not real 
It could be happening to you 
Say it's not true 
Say it's not right 
It's hard to believe 
The size of the crime 
Say it's not true 
Say it's not real 
It could be happening to you 
It could be happening to me


Surf's up
School's out
I got a criminal urge to
Twist and shout
I've been searching
My whole life through
For some perfect dream
Imagined in my youth
Follow that dream
Surf's up - School's out
Surf's up - School's out
For a perfect life
Find a perfect girl
You gotta follow that dream
To a perfect world
I've been a searcher
An adventurer too
This ride still runs
I wanna ride with you
This ride still runs
Wanna ride with you
Follow that dream
Surf's up - School's out
Surf's up - School's out
In the town and the country
We all lay and dreamed our dreams
Then we found the world is tough
And all is not quite what it seems
Gotta take it by the horns
Gotta seize your precious day
Got to follow your dream
Follow that dream
Follow that dream
Follow that dream
Surf's up - School's out
Follow that dream
Surf's up - School's out
Surf's up
Follow that dream
Surf's up - School's out
Surf's up - School's out
Follow that dream
Follow that dream


As I walk along I wonder 
What went wrong with our love 
A love that was so strong 
And as I still walk on I think of 
The things we've done together 
While our hearts were young 
I'm a-walking in the rain 
Tears are falling and I feel the pain 
Wishing you were here by me 
To end this misery and I wonder 
I wah, wah, wah, wah wonder 
Why 
Why, why, why, why, why she ran away 
And I wonder when she will stay 
My little runaway a-run, run, run, run, a-runaway 
I'm a-walking in the rain 
Tears are falling and I feel the pain 
Wishing you were here by me 
To end this misery and I wonder 
I wah, wah, wah, wah wonder 
Why 
Why, why, why, why, why she ran away 
And I wonder when she will stay 
My little runaway, a-run, run, run, run, a-runaway 
Run run run run runaway 
Run run run run runaway


They were talking in whispers
In bear skins and fur
Captain Scott and his heroes to be
To have laboured so long
To have made it this far
Ooh it's been such a long ride
Ooh you know it's been a long way

For a human body you see
Can you believe it happens?
Now it happens here
Do you believe do you believe or really care

Been such a long while
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah!
It's gonna be a long ride

When people talk of love
I'll lead the conversation
I'll say I feel just fine
Happy with my situation
But when I look away, huh
People know my mind straying
To where I once belonged
Dreaming about your heart again
(Your heart again, your heart again)
Let me in your heart again
We like to face the blues
I give you satisfaction (It's your heart again)
Despair was on your mind
I gave you the right direction (It's your heart again)
So don't you walk away
Remember it's my heart your breaking
You forget we were in love
Now my heart is only filled with pain
(Your heart again, your heart again)
Let me in your heart again
Oh my love I want you to stay
Don't leave me now or I'll just fade away
Oh my love, don't hurt me this way
Don't make me wait too long or I'll lose my mind
When people talk of love
I have no hesitation (It's your heart again)
Tell me what you're dreaming of
I'll hold a conversation for you babe (It's your heart again)
But when I look away, huh
People know my mind straying
To where I once belonged
Just let me in your heart again
Your heart again
Oh, let me in your heart again
Open the doors for me, babe
Your heart again
Let me in
Hey, love
Let me love
let me live and love in your heart again


With the morning I face the sun
I lift my head and smile for everyone
Every afternoon you'll find me working on
I got my new shoes on
Got to be moving on
(That's what they say)
Every night I'm tossed
And I shake my fevered brow
Thinking of my lost opportunity
Yes every morning I face the sun
I get so positive with everyone
And every afternoon 
you'll find the cracks showing through
They know what I'm going through
(Oh yes they do)
Every evening finds me
The optimist behind me
Gone with my lost opportunity


A hand above the water
An angel reaching for the sky
Is it raining in Heaven -
Do you want us to cry?
And everywhere the broken-hearted
On every lonely avenue
No-one could reach them
No-one but you
One by one
Only the Good die young
They're only flyin' too close to the sun
And life goes on -
Without you...
Another Tricky Situation
I get to drownin' in the Blues
And I find myself thinkin'
Well - what would you do?
Yea! - it was such an operation
Forever paying every due
Hell, you made a sensation
You found a way through - and
One by one
Only the Good die young
They're only flyin' too close to the sun
We'll remember -
Forever...
And now the party must be over
I guess we'll never understand
The sense of your leaving
Was it the way it was planned?
And so we grace another table
And raise our glasses one more time
There's a face at the window
And I ain't never, never sayin' goodbye...
One by one
Only the Good die young
They're only flyin' too close to the sun
Cryin' for nothing
Cryin' for no-one
No-one but you

So you feel that you ain't nobody
Always needed to be somebody
Put your feet on the ground
Put your hand on your heart
Lift your head to the stars
And the world's for your taking
(All you gotta do is save the world)
So you feel it's the end of the story
Find it all pretty satisfactory
Well I tell you my friend
This might seem like the end
But the continuation
Is yours for the making
Yes you're a hero (oooh yeah)[Instrumental]
