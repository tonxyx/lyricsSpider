It's been a minute since I saw you boy
Must admit it's good to hear your voice
And I guess that I forgot just how you make me feel when your around
See you haven't lost your sense of style
And you still could melt me with your smile
Can't deny that I still got these feelin' deep inside[Hook]
It's funny how things could change
But still remain the same
Isn't love just a crazy game
Baby here I go again[Chorus]
I look into your eyes and then
My heart remembers when
And I realize I neva gotten over you
Everytime I hear your name
It's like the sun shined through the rain
And I realize it's happening
Baby here I go again
Here I Go Again[Verse 2]
Still remember how you make me weak
How I fought to find the words to speak
I just cant excape the memories
I tried but I just cant break free
Thought I closed the door on what we had
But these feelings just keep comin back
Didn't think that you could make me loose control like that[Hook]
Sweet lovin' is my ting
So you know mi got fi swing
That's why yuh request it again
Without a doubt yuh want to spend
And to experience it again
Because yuh love the way yuh felt back then
So make me light it up again
Reignite the flames again
'Cause you really miss 'dem days when we used to chill
Up on the hill watch the sun set in West Nigril
Girl yuh Bajan beauty it a gimme di chill
Not to mention the way you are within[Chorus]


I want to let you know
That you don't have to go
Don't wonder no more
What I think about you
If it's loving that you want
Then you should make me your girl, your girl
If it's loving that you need
Baby come and share my world, share my world
If it's loving that you want
Then come and take a walk with me, walk with me
Cause, everything that you need, I got it right here baby, baby
Now it's obvious you need a friend to come hold you down
Be that one you share your everything when no one's around
Baby come tell me your secrets, and tell me all your dreams
'Cause I can see you need someone to trust
You can trust in me
Di di di di da da dey
So just call me whenever your lonely

A game that I know all to well now
Well I use to  buy your lines
But it's time for me to sail now[Chorus][Rap]
First you tellin me no
But please tell me yes

Straight up tell me yes
Gimme the keys to ya chest
Ya chest will rise neva rest

Hey Rihanna 
Your lovin really put me to the test
But if you shoulda let me soon the answer will yes
Yes to this yes to that yes to whateva you suggest
So please say yes
No no no[Verse 2]
Haters gonna hate

I found out much to late
I think I know were a little hot now
The truth leads to the lies
The heart aint always right
And I see that love is blind now
Boy you use to have my trust
Without no trust there aint no us boy[Chorus]

Once was a time you and I
Made a promise till the day we die
I trusted each and every word
Never thinking that I'd get burned
Silly me I believed in your fairy tales
Boy I thought that I knew you so very well
But you walked on my pride all the tears that I cried
And it cuts like a knife[Hook"]
It's the last time you're ever gonna kiss these lips
Or ever will deceive these eyes
Believe me when I tell you this
Baby boy it's the last time
I'm ever gonna cry these tears
I'm never gonna hear your lies
So listen while I make it clear
In case you didn't hear
This time's the last time
There's no time
To give it one more try
There's only time to say goodbye
Fooled me once shame on you
Fooled me twice now this song is through
The things you said I can never forget
The things you did fill my heart with regret
But I'm still standing tall as I walk away
And you know that it's true when you hear me say
It's over, it's through,
Ain't a thing you can do boy, its' sad but it's true[Hook:]
It's the last time you're ever gonna kiss these lips
Or ever will deceive these eyes
Believe me when I tell you this
Baby boy it's the last time
I'm ever gonna cry these tears
I'm never gonna hear your lies
So listen while I make it clear
In case you didn't hear
This time's the last time
There's no time
To give it one more try
There's only time to say goodbye
Good Bye No Baby
Silly me I believed in your fairy tales
Boy I thought that I knew you so very well
But you walked on my pride all the tears that I cried
And it cuts... like a knife[Hook:]
It's the last time you're ever gonna kiss these lips (ever gonna kiss these lips)
Or ever will deceive these eyes
Believe me when I tell you this
Baby boy it's the last time
I'm ever gonna cry these tears
I'm never gonna hear your lies (never gonna hear your lies)
So listen while I make it clear
In case you didn't hear
This time's the last time
There's no time
To give it one more try
It's over, it's through
Ain't a thing you can do but wonder why
There's only time to say goodbye
Baby goodbye
Never gonna, never gonna cry no more
Goodbye, goodbye

Gotta keep it on the down low
I'll never let my mama know
Only call him on my cell phone, only see him after dark
I met him on the 6 train, just the way he said my name
The brotha had a lot a game, had me open from the start
He scoops me up in his ride, Friday about a quarter to 9
So fly and so fine, and I'm so glad that he's all mine[Hook] There's a thug in my life, how'ma gonna tell my mama
She gonna say it ain't right, but he's so good to me
There's a thug in my life, and its gonna cause crazy drama
I'm gonna see him tonight, I'm gonna give him everything
I know his crew is kinda shady
Sometimes it gets kinda crazy
But he treats me like a lady, gives me everything I need
I don't care who's hating on me, 'cause every night he's waiting on me
He's got mad personality, a side they never see
My friends tell me to slow down, but everytime that he's around
My heart's on lock down, I feel love and I'm so proud[Hook]
There's a thug in my life, how'ma gonna tell my mama
She gonna say it ain't right, but he's so good to me
There's a thug in my life, and its gonna cause crazy drama
I'm gonna see him tonight, I'm gonna give him everything[Rap]
T-H-U-G in ya life baby
One in a million thats what you are to me
And I know your friends say I'm rough
But I still got that tender touch just to make u giggle and blush
But ya mom does not approve of us
She needs to be a lot more understanding
'Cause all I have for you is thug loving and loving thats all I'm giving[Bridge]
Mama, don't worry, I'm not in a hurry
I wont disappoint you, I wont make you sorry
He's the one for me (He's all I ever need)
We'll be together from now till forever
I know its the real thing, if you don't whatever
And I know its meant to be[Hook]
There's a thug in my life, how'ma gonna tell my mama
She gonna say it ain't right, but he's so good to me
There's a thug in my life, and its gonna cause crazy drama
I'm gonna see him tonight, I'm gonna give him everything[Bridge]
Mama, don't worry, I'm not in a hurry
I wont disappoint you, I wont make you sorry


[Verse 1:]
Took a chance, roll the dice of me and you
Opened up, let you in my world
Like a dance, started slow and then love took control
Swept away, so proud to be your girl
When you write a story much to fast
Sometimes a happy ending doesn’t last[Chorus:]
Now I know that love ain’t meant to be a play thing
Now I know it’s not an ordinary everyday thing
Now I know that when it's right it's so amazing
When it’s wrong you gotta let it go
Now I know
Now I know[Verse 2:]
Remember when, we said our love would last forever
But then again, how are we to know
There come a time, that love will change like stormy weather
A sunny day will suddenly turn cold
Time will teach you all you need to learn
But there’ll always be a first time you get burned[Chorus:]
Now I know that love ain’t meant to be a play thing
Now I know it’s not an ordinary everyday thing
Now I know that when it's right it's so amazing
When it’s wrong you gotta let it go
Now I know
Now I know[Hook:]
I don’t regret a single day
Joy and pain along the way
A broken heart’s the price we pay
As sad as it may seem
Baby can’t you see
It’s the way it’s gotta be[Chorus:]
Now I know that love ain’t meant to be a play thing
Now I know it’s not an ordinary everyday thing
Now I know that when it's right it's so amazing
When it’s wrong you gotta let it go
Now I know
Now I know
Yeah
Now I know
I know

[Intro]
Lalala lalala la la lala la Ohhh
You know... I never felt like this before
Lalala lalala la la lala la Ohhh
Feels like.. so real[Verse 1]
I'm obsessive when just one thought of you comes up
And I'm aggressive just one thought of close enough
You got me stressing, incessantly pressing the issue
'Cause every moment gone you know I miss you
I'm the question and you're of course the answer
Just hold me close boy 'cause I'm your tiny dancer
You make me shaken up, never mistaken
But I can't control myself, got me calling out for help[Chorus:]
S.O.S. please someone help me.
It's not healthy... for me to feel this way
Y.O.U. are making this hard,
I can't take it, see it don't feel right
S.O.S. please someone help me
It's not healthy... for me to feel this way
Y.O.U. are making this hard
You got me tossin' and turnin' and can't sleep at night[Bridge:]
This time please someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind it's got me losing it
I'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me
Love is testing me but still I'm losing it
This time please someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losing it
I'm lost, you got me looking for the rest of me,
Got the best of me, so now I'm losing it[Verse 2]
Just your presence and I second guess my sanity
Yes it's a lesson, it's unfair, you stole my vanity
My tummy's up in knots so when I see you I get so hot
My common sense is out the door, can't seem to find the lock
Take on me (uh huh) you know inside you feel it right[CD version:] Take me on I'm put desire up in your arms tonight[Video version:] Take me on, I could just die up in your arms tonight.
I'm out with you, you got me head over heels
Boy you keep me hanging on the way you make me feel[Chorus:]
S.O.S. please someone help me.
It's not healthy... for me to feel this way
Y.O.U. are making (Y.O.U.) this hard,
You got me tossin' and turnin' and can't sleep at night[Bridge:]
This time please someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losing it ('Cause you on my mind)
I'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me
Love is testing me but still I'm losing it
This time please someone come and rescue me (someone come and rescue me)
'Cause you on my mind got me losing it
I'm lost, you got me looking for the rest of me,
Got the best of me, so now I'm losing it
Boy, you know you got me feeling open
And boy, your loves enough with words unspoken
I said boy I'm telling you, you got me open
I don't know what to do it's true
I'm going crazy over you,
I'm begging[Chorus:]
S.O.S. please somebody help me.
It's not healthy... for me to feel this way
Y.O.U. are making this hard (are you making this hard for me, baby?),
You got me tossin' and turnin' and can't sleep at night[Bridge:]
This time please someone come and rescue me (someone rescue me)
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losing it
I'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me
Love is testing me but still I'm losing it
This time please someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind got me losing it ('cause any time)
I'm lost you, got me looking for the rest of me,
Got the best of me (best of me), I'm losing it[Outro]
Lala lala lala lala Ohhh
Ohh ohh lala lala lala lala
Oh oh


Kisses don't
No they don't
Never don't lie
You can run if you want but you cant hide
Telling you its the truth don't you ask why
Kisses don't
No they don't
Kisses don't lie[Verse 1:]
Emotions come and go
Who knows how the wind will blow?
There so little in this world to trust in
Seduce themselves with lies
Some don't realize
They call it love but its really only lusting[Refrain:]
So you see you and me
We're getting close to the danger zone
Show me how tell me now
Should I stay or should I go
Cause I'm caught between yes and no[Hook:]
Cause when you kiss me
I feel everything that I been missing
I try to slow down but my heart wont listen
And its tearing me all up inside
And when you touch me
I feel a rush but I'm afraid that it might crush me
Should I put my trust in something I don't trust in
I try to run but theres no place to hide
Cause baby kisses don't lie
Kisses don't
No they don't
Never don't lie
You can run if you want but you cant hide
Telling you its the truth don't you ask why
Kisses don't
No they don't
Kisses don't lie[Verse 2:]
You whisper in my ear
But are your words sincere
Cause pretty words can cut just like a knife
You see I'm nobody's fool
I play by my own rules
So please think twice before you step into my life[Refrain:]
So you see you and me
We're getting close to the danger zone
Show me how tell me now
Should I stay or should I go
Cause I'm caught between yes and no[Hook x2][Refrain][Hook]


Story of my life
Searching for the right
But it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul
'Cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company
He's more than a man
And this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in
Because I'm gone again
And to him I just can't be true
And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be...
A murderer
I feel it in the air
As I'm doing my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek
As he reluctantly
Asks if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long
Just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know
Where I'm about to go
And we know it very well
'Cause I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be...
A murderer
Our love, his trust
I might as well take a gun and put it to his head
Get it over with
I don't wanna do this
Anymore
Whoa, oh.
Anymore (anymore)
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
And every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
And I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be...
A murderer (a murderer)
No, no, no
Yeah, yeah, yeah


[Chorus:]
Ride when we ride we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
When we ride we ride
It's 'til the day that we die[Verse 1]
It's real late
'Bout a quarter to 1
I'm thinking about everything we've become
And I hate it
I thought we could make it
But I'm ready to dead this
Just wanna forget about it
I saw her pictures
And the letters she sent
You had me thinking
You were out we your friends
I'm so foolish
Play me like I'm stupid
'Cause I thought it was just you and I (oh)[Hook:]
Now I look back on the time
That we spent and
I see it in my mind
Playing over and over again
'Cause boy right now
You got me breaking down
And I just can't figure out why
But this is what you say[Chorus x2][Verse 2]
Visions in my mind
Of the day that we met
You showed me things
That I'll never forget
Took me swimming
In the ocean
You had my head up in the clouds
Made me feel like I'm floating (yeah)
You think I'm playing
When you know it's the truth
Nobody else can do it
Quite like I do
All my kisses
And my loving
But ain't nobody
Better than us[Hook][Chorus x2][Verse 3]
I guess it's over
Indefinitely
But you and I know
It's not that easy
To let go
Of everything (everything) that we planned
And start all over again
Just blame yourself cause you blew it
I won't forget how you do it
Sweet baby
This is where the game ends now
Somehow wanna believe you and me
We can figure it out[Chorus]
You finna make me say boy
I wish that you come hold me
When I'm lonely
When I need someone to talk to
You would phone me
Just like everything you told me
(when we ride we ride it's 'til the day that we die)
Boy you forgot about the promises
You made me
And now we'll let the memories
Just fade away
But I remember
What you used to say
(when we ride we ride it's 'til the day that we die)[Chorus x2]
We ride


[Verse 1:]
I'm not concerned with people 
Who prey on the wealth of their fellow man (oh yea)
Cause they only want to know you, enroll you
Only for the things ya had
I just think its so sad[Hook:]
Get dem haters out your circle 
Smile in your face but all they wanna do is bring ya down 
See them try to mess to hurt you
And work you
Anything to bring ya down[Verse 2:]
They keep evil thoughts in their hearts (what you dont know)
You can't let them knock your hustle
Not letting them know how much you struggle
They turn green with envy when your on top
And dem heart is full with strife
Their by gonna try to take your life[Hook:][Bridge:]
Ya know they talk about ya and they tell the lies
Dont be fooled u betta recognize
They not there for you
They dont care for you
Trust me cuz i know its true
Ya see they smile in your face and make ya think they down
Then they turn against you when your not around
Its just jealousy and dishonesty
So hold on to your sanity[Hook]


[Verse 1]
I never should of waited so long to say
What I've always known since the very first day
Thought that you would stay forever with me
But the time has come to leave[Chorus]
Before we turn out the lights and close our eyes
I'll tell you a secret I've held all my life
Its you that I live for, and for you I die
So I'll Lay here with you 'til the final goodbye[Verse 2]
Hold, draw me close, close to my lips
Listen intently as I tell you this
Outside the world wages its wars,
I'll rest in peace as long as you know[Chorus]
Before we turn out the lights and close our eyes
I'll tell you a secret I've held all my life
Its you that I live for, and for you I die
So I'll Lay here with you 'til the final goodbye[Bridge]
Promise you our love will carry on
Until you turn eternal, we belong[Chorus:]
Before we turn out the lights and close our eyes
I'll tell you a secret I've held all my life
It's you that I live for, and for you I die
So I'll lay here with you till the final goodbye
His respectful lips for the last time
And spell out the lyrics to love in the sky
Its you that I live for and for you I die
So I'll lay here with you till the final goodbye
Goodbye

Since I met you boy my whole worlds changed
I can't hide this or deny this[Chorus]
Boy you got me catching feelings
Got me thinking maybe you're the one
I didn't understand the reason

no other way[Bridge and fade]


[verse 1]
Whats up?
I know we haven't spoken for a while
But I was thinkin bout you
And it kinda made me smile
So many things to say
And I'll put em in a letter
Thought it might be easier
The words might come out better
How's your mother, how's your little brother?
Does he still look just like you?
So many things I wanna know the answers to
Wish I could press rewind
And rewrite every line
To the story of me and you[chorus]
Don't you know I've tried and I've tried
To get you out my mind
But it don't get no better
As each day goes by
And I'm lost and confused
I've got nothin to lose
Hope to hear from you soon
P.S. I'm still not over you
Still not over you[verse 2]
Excuse me, I really didn't mean to ramble on
But there's a lot of feelings that remain since you've been gone
I guess you thought that I would put it all behind me
But it seems there's always somethin right there to remind me
Like a silly joke, or somethin on the t.v.
Boy it aint easy
When I hear our song
I get that same old feeling
Wish I could press rewind
Turn back the hands of time
And I shouldn't be telling you[chorus]
Don't you know I've tried and I've tried
To get you out my mind
But it don't get no better
As each day goes by
And I'm lost and confused
I've got nothin to lose
Hope to hear from you soon
P.S. I'm still not over you
Still not over you
Did you know I kept all of your pictures
Don't have the strength to part with them yet
Oh no....
Tried to erase the way your kisses taste
But some things a girl can never forget[chorus]
Don't you know I've tried and I've tried
To get you out my mind
But it don't get no better
As each day goes by
And I'm lost and confused
I've got nothin to lose
Hope to hear from you soon
P.S. I'm still not over you
Still not over you


Some girls play the game
They all walk and talk
And they dress the same
Nothin' New To Say
Don't they realize
That it's so easy to see
Right though there disguise
Makes me wonder why
When the whole worlds turnin left
It's when I'm goin right
I need someone to let me be
Just who I am inside
`Cause a girl like me
Is just a lil' different from all the rest
And a girl likes me
Never gonna settle for Second Best
Could it be a boy like you
That would give me anything
If I asked him to
To take all my dreams
And Make them true
Show me all the reasons that you
Ought to be with a girl like me
Just like me
Possibility
Got me trippin'
Thinkin' of what could be
Between you and me
Still I need to know
Should I keep this feelin'
Or let it go
I can't wait no more
So now's the time
To speak your mind
And Show me what you feel
So tell me if you
Want to take a chance
On something real
`Cause a girl like me
Is just a lil' different from all the rest
And a girl likes me
Never gonna settle for Second Best
Could it be a boy like you
That would give me anything
If I asked him to
To take all my dreams
And Make them true
Show me all the reasons that you
Ought to be with a girl like me
Just like me
Mirror Mirror on the wall
Catch me now before I fall
I wish I may, I wish I might
Find the Answer here tonight
Mirror Mirror on the wall
Catch me now before I fall

Here we lay face to face once again
Silence cuts like a knife as we pretend.
And I'm wondering who will be the first to say what we both know
We're just holding on to "could have been"s and we should be letting go.[Chorus:]
It feels like you're a million miles away as you're lying here with me tonight.
I can't even find the words to say I can find a way to make it right.
And we both know that the story's ending,
We play the part but we're just pretending and I can't hide the tears
'cause even though you're here,
It feels like you're a million miles away.
Was it me, or was it you that broke away?
For what we were is like a season love is change
And every time I think about it, it tears me up inside.
Like the rivers of emotion but I got no more tears to cry.[Chorus:][Music Plays:][Bridge]
We can try to talk it over but we walked that road before,
While our song is playing its last note,
We both know for sure that it's time to close that door.[Chorus:]

As long as we’ve been together

Nobody knows you better

When your friends start to trip 
And you’re loosin your grip 
And you cant find your way back home 
When your world falls apart 
And you’re lost in the dark

When you just can deal, and you need something real 
Someone that’ll always come through 
Who ya gonna run to?

You and me we go back to jump rope and grade school 
Memories when you were tryin’ so hard to play cool

As long as we’ve been together 
You’ve always been the one 
Nobody knows you better 
When all is said and done 
When your friends start to trip 
And you’re loosin your grip 
And you cant find your way back home 
When your world falls apart 
And you’re lost in the dark 
And you know that your all alone 
When you just can deal, and you need something real 
Someone that’ll always come through 
Who ya gonna run to?

There ain’t nobody who can ever understand like I do (I do) 
So when you realise you need the one you said goodbye to (bye to)

You know I’m gonna be right there (right there) 
When your friends start to trip 
And your loosin your grip

And you know that your all alone 
When you just can deal, and you need something real 
Someone that’ll always come through

When there’s nobody else in the world you can put your trust in 
(Who ya gonna run to) 
And you find all the haters around you, they don’t mean nothing 
(Who ya gonna run to) 
Who ya gonna run to?


Looking back it's hard for me to see
Just how I could have been so blind
Like an actor on a movie screen
You played the part with every line
Well every story doesn't have a happy ending
Sometimes a flower doesn't grow
I hope you understand the message that I'm sending
But boy I think you need to know
(Coulda been the one)
That I would give it all to catch you when you fall boo
(Shoulda been the one)
Didn't know just what you had boy
Now it's just too bad boy
(After all is said and done)
You're a cheater and a liar
Went to play with fire
Boy I hope that you enjoyed your fun
Cuz you coulda been the one
There's nothing left to say
Coulda been the one
Coulda been
Shoulda been
My momma didn't raise no fool
She said play with fire you get burned
You laughed at me, I laugh at you
Now it seems the table's turned
I must admit I really thought you had potential
But I could not have been more wrong
I need somebody I can trust with his essentials
You had your chance but now I'm long gone
(Coulda been the one)
I would give it all to catch you when you fall boo
(Shoulda been the one)
Didn't know just what you had boy
Now it's just too bad boy
(After all is said and done)
You're a cheater and a liar
Went to play with fire
Boy I hope that you enjoyed your fun
Cuz you coulda been the one
You coulda been the one baby
(You coulda been the one)
Oh yeah
You played yourself boy
And there is no denying it
It's just the way the story goes
You made your bed boy
Better go and lay in it
But know that you'll be laying there alone
You coulda been the one
(Coulda been the one)
I would give it all to catch you when you fall boo
(Shoulda been the one)
Didn't know just what you had boy
Now it's just too bad boy
(After all is said and done)
You're a cheater and a liar
Went to play with fire
Boy I hope that you enjoyed your fun
Cuz you coulda been the one

Uh huh, uh huh (Yea Rihanna)
Uh huh, uh huh (Good girl gone bad)
Uh huh, uh huh (Take three... Action)
Uh huh, uh huh
No clouds in my stones
Let it rain, I hydroplane in the bank
Coming down with the Dow Jones
When the clouds come we gone, we Rocafella
We fly higher than weather
In G5's are better, You know me,
In anticipation, for precipitation. Stack chips for the rainy day
Jay, Rain Man is back with little Ms. Sunshine
Rihanna where you at?[Rihanna]
You have my heart
And we'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines
But you'll still be my star
Baby 'cause in the dark
You can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you I'll always share
Because[Chorus]
When the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'd be here forever
Said I'll always be a friend
Took an oath I'ma stick it out 'til the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella
(Ella ella eh eh eh)
Under my umbrella
(Ella ella eh eh eh)
Under my umbrella
(Ella ella eh eh eh)
Under my umbrella
(Ella ella eh eh eh eh eh eh)
These fancy things, will never come in between
You're part of my entity, here for infinity
When the war has took its part
When the world has dealt its cards
If the hand is hard, together we'll mend your heart
Because[Chorus]
When the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'd be here forever
Said I'll always be a friend
Took an oath I'ma stick it out 'til the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella
(Ella ella eh eh eh)
Under my umbrella
(Ella ella eh eh eh)
Under my umbrella
(Ella ella eh eh eh)
Under my umbrella
(Ella ella eh eh eh eh eh eh)
You can run into my arms
It's OK, don't be alarmed
Come here to me
There's no distance in between our love
So go on and let the rain pour
I'll be all you need and more
Because[Chorus]
When the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be a friend
Took an oath I'ma stick it out 'til the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella
(Ella ella eh eh eh)
Under my umbrella
(Ella ella eh eh eh)
Under my umbrella
(Ella ella eh eh eh)
Under my umbrella
(Ella ella eh eh eh eh eh eh)

We break, break, we break, break, we break, break we're breaking down [2x]
It's getting later baby, and I'm getting curious
nobody's looking at us, I feel delirious
'cause the beat penetrates my body
shaking inside my bones
and you pushing all my buttons, taking me outta my zone[Bridge:]
The way that you stare, starts a fire in me
Come up to my room you sexy little thing
And let's play a game, I won't be a tease
I'll show you the room, my sexy little thing[Chorus:]
I wish you would push up on me
I wish you would push up on me
I wish you would light me up and say you want me
push up on me [2x]
I know many guys just like ya, extremely confident
Got so much flavor with you, like you're the perfect man
You wanna make me chase ya like it's a compliment
But let's get right down to it
I could be the girl that'll break you down[Bridge][Chorus]
We break, break, we break, break, we break, break we're breaking down [2x]
I wanna see how you move
Show me, show me how you do it
You really got me on it, I must confess
Baby there ain't nothing to it
Baby, who you think you're fooling?
You wanna come get me outta my dress[Bridge][Chorus]


Please don't stop the music
Please don't stop the music
Please don't stop the music
Please don't stop the music
It's getting late
I'm making my way over to my favourite place
I gotta get my body moving
Shake the stress away
I wasn't looking for nobody when you looked my way
Possible candidate, yeah
Who knew
That you'd be up in here looking like you do
You're making staying over here, impossible
Baby, I must say your aura is incredible
If you don't have to go, don't
Do you know what you started?
I just came here to party
But now we're rocking on the dance floor, actin' naughty
Your hands around my waist
Just let the music play
We're hand in hand, chest to chest and now we're face to face[CHORUS]
I wanna take you away
Let's escape into the music, DJ let it play
I just can't refuse it
Like the way you do this
Keep on rockin' to it
Please don't stop the, please don't stop the music
I wanna take you away
Let's escape into the music, DJ let it play
I just can't refuse it
Like the way you do this
Keep on rockin' to it
Please don't stop the, please don't stop the
Please don't stop the music
Baby are you ready cause it's getting close
Don't you feel the passion ready to explode?
What goes on between us no-one has to know
This is a private show
Do you know what you started?
I just came here to party
But now we're rocking on the dance floor, actin' naughty
Your hands around my waist
Just let the music play
We're hand in hand, chest to chest and now we're face to face[CHORUS][x4]
Please don't stop the music[CHORUS x2]
Please don't stop the music
Please don't stop the music

[Verse 1]
I've been looking for a driver who's qualified
So if you think that you're the one step into my ride
I'm a fine-tuned supersonic speed machine
With a sunroof top and a gangster lean[Bridge]
So if you feel me let me know, know, know
Come on now what you waiting for, for, for
My engine's ready to explode, explode, explode
So start me up and watch me go, go, go, go[Chorus] 
Got you where you wanna go if you know what i mean
Got a ride that smoother than a limosine
Can you handle the curves? Can you run all the lights?
If you can baby boy then we can go all night
Cos I'm 0 to 60 in three point five
Baby you got the keys-
Now shut up and drive
(drive, drive, drive)
Shut up and drive
(drive, drive, drive)[Verse 2]

Got all the drive but a whole lot of boom in the back
You look like you can handle whats under my hood
You keep saying that you will boy I wish you would[Bridge]
So if you feel me let me know, know, know
Come on now what you waiting for, for, for
My engine's ready to explode, explode, explode
So start me up and watch me go, go, go, go[Chorus] 
Got you where you wanna go if you know what i mean
Got a ride that smoother than a limosine

[Rihanna:]
That's how much I love you
That's how much I need you
And I can't stand you
Must everything you do make me wanna smile
Can I not like you for awhile? (No....)[Ne-Yo:]
But you won't let me
You upset me girl
And then you kiss my lips
All of a sudden I forget (that I was upset)
Can't remember what you did[Rihanna:]
But I hate it...
You know exactly what to do
So that I can't stay mad at you
For too long that's wrong[Ne-Yo:]
But I hate it...
You know exactly how to touch
So that I don't want to fuss.. and fight no more
Said I despise that I adore you[Rihanna:]
And I hate how much I love you boy (yeah...)
I can't stand how much I need you (I need you...)
And I hate how much I love you boy (oh whoa..)
But I just can't let you go
And I hate that I love you so (oh..)[Ne-Yo:]
You completely know the power that you have
The only one makes me laugh[Rihanna:]
Said it's not fair
How you take advantage of the fact
That I... love you beyond the reason why
And it just ain't right[Ne-Yo:]
And I hate how much I love you girl
I can't stand how much I need you (yeah..)
And I hate how much I love you girl
But I just can't let you go
But I hate that I love you so[Both:]
One of these days maybe your magic won't affect me
And your kiss won't make me weak
But no one in this world knows me the way you know me
So you'll probably always have a spell on me...[Ne-Yo:]
Yeah... Oh...[Rihanna:]
That's how much I love you (as much as I need you)
That's how much I need you (oh..)
That's how much I love you (oh..)
As much as I need you[Rihanna:]
And I hate that I love you so
And I hate how much I love you boy
I can't stand how much I need you (can't stand how much I need you)
And I hate how much I love you boy
But I just can't let you go (but I just can't let you go no..)
And I hate that I love you so
And I hate that I love you so.. so...

[Verse 1]
Sell me candy like it’s summer when it’s melting in my hands
I know you’re around like the ice cream man
I can hear you calling, whisper something in my ear
You're sweet like sugar, tell me what I wanna hear
I’m weak by your touch and when it’s melting on my lips
I run through my body when you lick my fingertips
You’re selling me a fantasy that I want to explore
It sounds so good spoil me rotten to the core[Bridge:]
Talk to me
Take care of my dreams
All I need
Is you beside me
It’s destiny
Just let it be
If words can speak
Then baby sell it to me[Chorus:]
Sell me candy, sell me love, sell me heaven, sell me doves
What’s the charge? What’s the cost?
(I’m the daddy)… you the boss.[Verse 2]
You could be a professional, boy you make a sale
I try to resist but every time I fail
The one temptation that I gotta endure
The running through my body now you’re knocking at my door
A thin little kiss and your call is really sweet
But the shawty that you’re rocking is nothing like me
You’re selling me a fantasy that I want to explore
It sounds so good spoil me rotten to the core (you know…)[Bridge][Chorus][Verse 3]
I wanna play… more than you know
So don’t you leave… and don’t you go
I want it all… until time falls
His arms… I want to roam
I want to love… give him my trust
I want to live… for both of us
I want to breathe you… lay on your shoulder
I want to warm you… when nights get colder
I want love… love… love
I want love… love… love[Bridge][Chorus]


[Chorus]
I got a house, but I need new furniture,
Why spend mine when I could spend yours
The truth is I will love you the same
But why complain you buying gucci babe[Verse 1]
You might see me in the spot
Ya boy think I'm hot
So I came up in here to get what you got
I'm hot like the block
Ugh Huh you like that

Ugh Huh yea right there
They love the young girl
They wanna give it to me
Wish I was in a flick
And I ain't talking movies
If ya young,if ya hot girl
Shake what ya got girl
I keep 'em singing...[Pre-Hook]
Lemme hit that (Huh?)

(Justin I wanna put it on blast)
Lemme get that (Huh?)
(Rihanna Better slow down, for I make you crash boy)
Got what you want
Baby got what you need,
But we can't proceed 
Unless you got that for me[Chorus][Verse 2]
I'm a put you on the spot
keep the sheet in knots
I bought me a benz, 
You buy me the yacht
A girl need a lot, 
The girl need some stocks
Bonds is what I got, bonds is what I got (ya get it?)
They love the young girl
They wanna give it to me
Wish I was in a flick,
and I ain't talking movies
If ya young, if ya hot girl
Shake what ya got girl
I keep em singing...[Pre-Hook][Chorus][Bridge]
Oh...Oh...Oh...
Boy I know you want my love
Oh...Oh...Oh...
Nothing is free in this world
Oh...Oh...Oh...
Unless my love is your love
Oh...Oh...Oh...
I'm not a gold digger[Pre-Hook][Chorus-End]


[Verse 1:]
Baby, baby
When we first met
I never felt something so strong
You were like my lover
And my best friend
All wrapped into one
With a ribbon on it
And all of a sudden
you went and left
I didn't know how to follow
It's like a shock
That spun me around
And now my heart's dead
I feel so empty and hollow[Pre Chorus:]
And I'll never give myself to another
The way I gave it to you
Don't even recognize
The ways you hurt me
Do you?
It's gonna take a miracle to bring me back
And you're the one to blame[Chorus:]
And now I feel like, oh
You're the reason
Why I'm thinking
I don't wanna smoke on
These cigarettes no more
I guess that's what I get
For wishful thinking
Should've never let you enter my door
Next time you wanna go on and leave
I should just let you go on and do it
Cause now I'm using like I bleed
It's like I checked into rehab
Baby you're my disease
It's like I checked into rehab
Baby you're my disease
I gotta check into rehab
'Cause baby you're my disease
I gotta check into rehab
'Cause baby you're my disease[Verse 2:]
Damn,
Ain't it crazy
When you're loveswept
You'll do anything
For the one you love
'Cause anytime
That you needed me
I'd be there
It's like
You were my favorite drug
The only problem is
That you was using me
In a different way
That I was using you
But now that I know
That it's not meant to be
You gotta go
I gotta wean myself off of you[Pre Chorus:][Chorus:][Ad libs][Chorus:]


Take off my shirt.
Loosen the buttons and undo my skirt,
Stare at myself in the mirror
Take me apart piece by piece,
Sorrow decrease
Pressure release, I put in work
Did more than called upon, More than deserved
When it was over, Did I wind up hurt (Yes)?
But it taught me before a decision ask this question first[Chorus:]
Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances are given, Question Existing
Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances are given, Question Existing
Take off my coat,
show them that under here,
I'm just like you do the mistakes,
I may make me a fool or a human with flaws,
admit that I'm loss
Round of applause,
Take the abuse
Sometimes it feels like they want me to lose
It's entertainment is that an excuse? (No)
But the question that lingers whether "win or lose"[Chorus]
Dear Diary,
It's Robyn
Entertaining is something I do for a living
It's not who I am, I'd like to think that I'm pretty normal,
I laugh, I get mad, I hurt, I think
Guys suck sometimes,
But when you're in the spotlight,
Everything seems good,
Sometimes I feel like i have it worst cause I have to always keep my guard up,
I don't know who to trust, I don't know who wants to date me for who I am,
Or who wants to be my friend for who I really am,[Chorus]


We stay moving around, solo
Ask us where you at, we don't know
And don't care (don't care)
All we know is we was at home cause you left us there
You got your boys and got gone
And left us all alone
Now she in the club with a freaky dress on
Cats don't want her to keep that dress on
Trying to get enough drinks in her system
Take it to the tele and make her a victim
Patron on brain, ball play you in the face
They shake the spot, she's just another case[Chorus]
Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we gone (gone)
Best believe we've gone forever
Don't be the reason
Don't be the reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad
We die forever
He's staying with a flock of them, oh, yeah
Got a girl at home but he don't care
Won't care (won't care)
All he'll do is keep me at home, won't let me go nowhere
He thinks because I'm at home I won't be getting it on
And now I'm finding numbers in the jacket pockets
Tricks calling the house, non stop its
Getting out of control
Finally I can't take no more
He finds a letter on the stairs, saying this is the end
I packed my bag and left with your best friend[Chorus]
We stay moving around, solo
Ask us where you at, we don't know
And don't care (don't care)
All we know is we was at home cause you left us there
You got your boys and got gone
And left us all alone[Chorus]
We're gone forever
We're gone forever


I'm not the type to get my heart broken
I'm not the type to get upset and cry
'cause I never leave my heart open
Never hurts me to say goodbye
Relationships don't get deep to me
Never got the whole in love thing
And someone can say they love me truly
But at the time it didn't mean a thing[Chorus:]
My mind is gone, I'm spinning round
And deep inside, my tears I'll drown
I'm losing grip, what's happening
I stray from love, this is how I feel
This time was different
Felt like, I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I'm, in this condition
And I've, got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what you'll never see me cry
Did it happen when we first kissed?
'cause it's hurting me to let it go
Maybe 'cause we spent so much time
And I know that it's no more
I should've never let you hold me baby
Maybe why I'm sad to see us apart
I didn't give to you on purpose
Can't figure out how you stole my heart[Chorus]
How did I get here with you, I'll never know?
I never meant to let it get so, personal
And after all I tried to do, to stay away from loving you
I'm broken hearted, I can't let you know
And I won't let it show
You won't see me cry[x2]
This time was different
Felt like, I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I'm, in this condition
And I've, got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what you'll never see me cry
All my life...


[Verse 1:]
The steps on the stairs
Aren't really there
Feel like there's someone watching me
Shadows on the wall
Whispers down the hall
When I look theres nothing to see
You say that you let her go
Turn the page and closed the door
Can't get inside your head
'cause when I try, she's there instead[Chorus:]
I can't compete with a memory
How can I fight with someone that I can't see?
Theres two of us but it feels like three
I wish her ghost would just let us be
Boy your everything I ever wanted
But I got to let you go 'cause this love is...
Haunted
Haunted[Verse 2:]
You say that shes gone
That you've moved on
so why do I feel her eyes on me
Invisible chains keep us in pain
Won't you please tell her set you free?
Sometimes when you look past me
Your eyes see someone I can't see
So I've given up this war
'cause I can't fight it anymore[Chorus:]
I can't compete with a memory
How can I fight with someone that I can't see?
Theres two of us but it feels like three
I wish her ghost would just let us be
Boy your everything I ever wanted
But I got to let you go 'cause this love is...
Haunted
Haunted[Bridge:]
Wish I could cast a spell to make her spirit leave
The walls close and then its so damn hard to breath[Spoken Whisper:] There is nothing I could do about it...[Chorus:]
I can't compete with a memory
How can I fight with someone that I can't see?
Theres two of us but it feels like three
I wish her ghost would just let us be
Boy your everything I ever wanted
But I got to let you go 'cause this love is...
Haunted
Haunted...
Haunted
Haunted
I don't want to fight anymore
Someone is walking out that door...
Haunted
Haunted...

What's wrong with me?
Why do I feel like this?
I'm going crazy now
No more gas in the rig

Nothing heard, nothing said
Can't even speak about it
Out my life, out my head
Don't wanna think about it
Feels like I'm going insane

To come and grab you
It can creep up inside you
And consume you
A disease of the mind
It can control you

Throw on your brake lights
We're in the city of wonder
Ain't gonna play nice
Watch out, you might just go under
Better think twice
Your train of thought will be altered
So if you must falter be wise
Your mind is in disturbia

Oh, how about a round of applause, yeah
A standing ovation
Oh, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You look so dumb right now
Standing outside my house
Trying to apologize
You're so ugly when you cry
Please, just cut it out[Chorus:]
Don't tell me you're sorry 'cause you're not
Baby when I know you're only sorry you got caught
But you put on quite a show
Really had me going
But now it's time to go
Curtain's finally closing
That was quite a show
Very entertaining
But it's over now (but it's over now)
Go on and take a bow
Grab your clothes and get gone (get gone)
You better hurry up
Before the sprinklers come on (come on)
Talking' bout'
Girl, I love you, you're the one
This just looks like a re-run
Please, what else is on (on)[Chorus][Bridge]
Oh, and the award for
The best lie goes to you (goes to you)
For making me believe (that you)
That you could be faithful to me
Let's hear your speech, oh
How about a round of applause
A standing ovation
But you put on quite a show
Really had me going
Now it's time to go
Curtain's finally closing
That was quite a show
Very entertaining
But it's over now (but it's over now)
Go on and take a bow
But it's over now


[Maroon 5] 
Now as the summer fades, I let you slip away 
You say I'm not your type, But I can make you sway. 
It makes you burn to learn, you're not the only one 
I'd let you be if you put down your blazing gun. [Rihanna] 
Now you've gone somewhere else, Far away 
I don't know if I will find you (find you, find you). 
But you feel my breath, on your neck 
Can't believe I'm right behind you (right behind you). [Both] 
'Cause you keep me coming back for more (Coming back for more)
And I feel a little better than I did before [Rihanna]
And if I never see your face again, I don't mind [Both]
'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight [Rihanna] 
Sometimes you move so well 
It's hard not to give in. [Maroon 5] 
I'm lost, I can't tell 
Where you end and I begin. [Rihanna] 
It makes you burn to learn 
I'm with another man. [Maroon 5] 
I wonder if he's half 
The lover that I am. 
Now you've gone somewhere else, Far away 
I don't know if I will find you (find you, find you). 
But you feel my breath, on your neck 
Can't believe I'm right behind you (right behind you). [Both] 
'Cause you keep me coming back for more (Coming back for more) 
And I feel a little better than I did before [Rihanna]
If I never see your face again, I don't mind [Both]
'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight [Maroon 5] 
Baby, baby 
Please believe me 
Find it in your heart to reach me 
Promise not to leave me behind 
(Promise not to leave me behind) [Rihanna] 
Take me down, but take it easy 
Make me think but don't deceive me 
Torture me by taking your time 
(Torture me, torture me)  
'Cause you keep me coming back for more 
And I feel a little better than I did before [Both] 
If I never see your face again, I don't mind 
'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight (torture me, torture me)[Both] 
'Cause you keep me coming back for more (Coming back for more)
And I feel a little better than I did before (Did before)
And if I never see your face again, I don't mind 
'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight

Brilliant, resilient
Fan mail from 27 millions
And I want it all

Go hard or go home
Back to your residence
Soon the red dogs will give the block back to the presidents
I used to run my own block like Obama did
You ain't gotta believe me, go ask my momma then
You couldn't even come in my room
it smelled like a kilo
Looked like me and two of my boys playing casino
Trying to sell they peeping my bag they can't afford it
Tell 'em to give me back my swag
They tryin' to clone me
See my Louis tux, Louis flag, Louis frames, Louis belt
What that make me
Louis mane?
I'm in an all white party wearin' all black
With my new black watch call it the heart attack
Cardiac arrest, cardiac a wrist
Yeah, they say they're hard
They ain't hard as this
Hard!
The one word describes me
If I wasn't doin' this
You know where I be, too hard
Where dem girls talkin' trash
Where dem girls talkin' trash
Where they at, where they at, where they at?
Where dem bloggers girls at
Where dem bloggers girls at
Where they at, where they at, where they at?
Where your lighters at

Stupid in love
Oh
Stupid in love
Let me tell you something
Never have I ever
Been a size 10
In my whole life
I left the engine running
I just came to see
What you would do if I
Gave you a chance
To make things right
So I made it
Even though Katy
Told me this would be nothing
But a waste of time
And she was right
Dont understand it
Blood on your hands
And still you insist
On repeatedly trying
To tell me lies
And I just don't know why
This is stupid
I'm not stupid
Dont talk to me
Like Im stupid
I still love you
But I just cant do this
I may be dumb but
I'm not stupid
My new nickname
Is you idiot
(Such an idiot)
Thats what my friends
Are calling me when
They see me yelling
Into my
Phone
They tell me let go
He is not the one
I thought I saw your potential
Guess thats what made me dumb
He don't want it
Not like you want it
Scheming and cheating
Oh girl, why do you
Waste your time
You know he aint right
Telling me this
I don't wanna listen
But you insist
On repeatedly trying
To tell me lies
And I just don't know why
This is stupid
I'm not stupid
Dont talk to me
Like I'm stupid
I still love you
But I just cant do this
I may be dumb but
I'm not stupid
Trying to make this work
But you act like a jerk
Silly of me to keep
Holding on
But the dunce cap is off
You don't know what you lost
And you wont realize
Till I'm gone, gone, gone
That I was the one
Which one of us
Is really dumb
Ooh
No
No
No
I'm not stupid in love
This is stupid
I'm not stupid
Dont talk to me
Like I'm stupid
I still love you
But I just cant do this
I may be dumb but
I'm not stupid
I may be dumb but
I'm not stupid
In love

Oh, baby I'm a
Oh, baby I'm a
Hey, hey, hey


Uh, uh [sound of taking breath][Verse 1]
Take a breath,
Take it deep. 
'Calm yourself', He says to me
If you play, you play for keeps. 
Take the gun and count to three.
Im sweating now,
Moving slow,
No time to think. My turn to go[Hook]
And you can see my heart beating
You can see it through my chest.
Said I'm terrified but I'm not leaving
I know that I must pass this test
So, just pull the trigger[Verse 2]
Say a prayer to yourself
He says 'close your eyes, sometimes it helps'
And then I get a scary thought
That he's here - means he's never lost [Hook]
And you can see my heart beating.
No, You can see it through my chest.
Said I'm terrified but I'm not leaving
Know that I must pass this test. 
So, just pull my trigger [Bridge]
As my life flashes before my eyes
I'm wondering will I ever see another sunrise?
So many won't get the chance to say good-bye
But its too late to think of the value of my life[Hook]
And you can see my heart beating.
No, You can see it through my chest.
Said I'm terrified but I'm not leaving no
know that I must pass this test.
You can see my heart beating.
Oh, You can see it through my chest.
I'm terrified but I'm not leaving no
know that I must pass this test.
So, just pull the trigger[sound of taking a breath][sound of pulling the trigger. Gun shot]


Yeah
Whoa
Gunfire left a hole
In the tank
Losing gasoline
Fire is on my trail
And he's after me
Hope it dont get here
Before I get where Im going
I gotta get where Im going
Take off my mask to breathe
You couldve been a apart of a
Masterpiece
Fluid in the breaks
Was the last to leave
Thats the thing
Where I'm going
I dont need my breaks
Cant wait to see your face
When your front windows break
And I come crashing through
The lovers need to clear the road
Oh, oh, oh
Cause this thing is ready to blow
Oh, oh, oh
I just wanna set you on fire
So I wont have to burn alone
Then you
Then youll know where
I'm coming from
Fire bomb
Fire bomb
Seems cold
But baby no
Doesnt have to be
Microwaving our medal tragedy
Watching it burn and
Its beautiful and its blue
And its pitiful
When its through
Its the other half of me
I didnt do it
You lit the match for me
Now were flying
From the blast, baby
Thats the thing
Where were going
We dont need no breaks
Cant wait to see your face
When your front windows break
And I come crashing through
The lovers need to clear the road
Oh, oh, oh
Cause this thing is ready to blow
Oh, oh, oh
I just wanna set you on fire
So I wont have to burn alone
Then you
Then youll know where
Im coming from
Fire bomb
Fire bomb
Baby we were killing them
They couldnt handle the millionth degree
We were criminals
As we were burning
The world called the police
Fire department, ambulance
You can call me crazy cause I believe
The only move for me and you
Is to go out blazing
The lovers need to clear the road
Oh, oh, oh
Cause this thing is ready to blow
Oh, oh, oh
I just wanna set you on fire
So I wont have to burn alone
Then you
Then youll know where
Im coming from
Fire bomb
Oh, oh, oh
Fire bomb

Fell in love, I fell in love
Thought he was the one for me
Other boys I could not see
And look what happened to our love
I'm like how could it be?
It should have been me and you
It could have been you and me
Boy you broke my heart and now I'm standing here
It should have been me and you
It could have been you and me
Now all I've got are these photographs
All I've got, all I've got

The fact that you ain't around
Baby I'm falling down
I need me a remedy
Been looking for remedies
I need you to be around
And baby I'm hurting now

Te amo, te amo
she says to me
I hear the pain in her voice..
then we danced underneath the candelabra
she takes the lead
that's when I saw it in her eyes, it's over[Chorus:]
Then she said te amo
then she put her hand around me waist
I told her no,
She cried te amo
I told her I'm not gonna run away
but let me go
My soul is awry,
without asking why
I said te amo,
wish somebody'd tell me what she said?
Don't it mean I love you
Think it means I love you
Don't it mean I love you
Te amo, te amo,
She's scared to breathe
I hold her hand, I got no choice, uh
Pulled me out on the beach, danced in the water,
I start to leave
She's begging me and asking why it's over[Chorus]
Listen we can dance,
but you gotta watch your hands
watch me all night,
I'm movin' to the night
because I understand
that we all need love
and I'm not afraid
to feel the love but I don't feel that way[Chorus]
Think it means I love you,
I love you
Te amo, te amo
Don't it mean I love you


On my roof
Dark and I'm burning a rose
I don't need proof
I'm torn apart & you know
What you did to me was a crime
Cold Case Love
And I let you reach me one more time
But that's enough
Your love was breaking the law
But I needed a witness
So pick me up when it's over
It don't make any difference
Will it ever be solved
Or am I taking the fall
Truth was there all along
Tell me how did we miss it
We opened up a cold case love
And it got the best of us
And now prints, pictures & white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime
Of a cold case love
Should've investigated
But love blinded eyes
Couldn't see (no)
And then I tried to cage it
But your love ain't the kind you can keep
Release me now cause I did my time
Of this cold case love
My heart's no longer cold & confined
I've had enough
Your love was breaking the law
But I needed a witness
So pick me up when it's over
It don't make any difference
Will it ever be solved
Or am I taking the fall
Truth was there all along
Tell me how did we miss it
We opened up a cold case love
And it got the best of us
And now prints, pictures & white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime
Of a cold case love
We lost our way
Took this too far
Now I'll never find the pieces of my heart
We've lost enough
Looking for a truth
That was here all along
Cold case love
And it got the best of us
and now prints, pictures & white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime
Of a cold case love
We opened up a cold case love
And it got the best of us
and now prints, pictures & white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime
Of a cold case love


Here we are
Midair off of the cliff
Staring down at the end again
But then again maybe we're finally
On the road that's heading away from all your complaining
Of hearing the same song but baby we'll hear it when i'm gone
It's time to turn on the last song
Ooooo
The last song
Ooooo
What if you wasted love and our love in time disappeared and the sad song ends up being the last song you'll ever hear
It was ours
But I'd do it again holding hands with my friend again
But then again maybe we gave our all a song we'll never forget
Maybe let them play it maybe it'll save the world
They gonna miss her when it's gone
But it's time to turn up the last song
Ooooo
The last song
Ooooo
What if we left every moment that we could spare and the perfect song will end up being the last song you'll ever hear
You'll never know when the songs gonna play the last song you'll hear is the one you made this song was beautiful that's why I started singing it
But this song is our song is playing until the end even if the last song
The last song
Ooooo
The last song
Ooooo
What if you wasted love and our love in time disappeared and the perfect song ends up being the last song you'll ever hear
Ooooooooooooooooooooooo


You got a hole in your head
You got a hole in your head girl
You got a hole in your head
You got a hole in your head girl
You got a hole in your head
You got a hole in your head girl[Rihanna:]
No use, your lips keep moving
But I got a couple screws loose
Them other boys talkin' about me
They say I'm bad news, and
Probably best for you to keep this short
It's my time to interupt,
It's time to start me up[Bridge:]
I don't think you wanna do that right now
And not with me, don't start with me I got a gun on me
I don't think you really wanna run your mouth
I gotta feeling, I'll burn it down, I'll burn you down
All over your radio, see me in the stadium
I'll spin your body,
Let these ladies know
Don't bring this hoe around me
Don't push my buttons
You don't really wanna see me get wild
Wanna see me get wild[Chorus:]
I got a hole in my head
A hole in my head
Sometimes I get crazy and
I ain't scared of nobody
Don't look at me funny
Like you ain't hear what I said
I gotta hole in my head
Ay ay ay I gotta hole in my head
Ay ay ay I gotta hole in my head
Don't look at me funny
Like you ain't hear what I said
Ay ay ay I gotta hole in my head
Buckle up, I ride this like a fast car
Suck it up, don't even try to act hard
And you can try to run But you won't get very far
And you can try to hide but I know where you are
Let loose, I see right through you,
you got a hole in your head too
And I knew it the very moment i met you
So I hope you got your swagger up
You know just what I love
Really take a lot to start me up[Bridge]
Catch me on your mind baby
Don't waste my time baby
Now watch me wind
You can take that as a sign baby
So left and right baby
So push my buttons
You see me get wild
Uh go wild baby[Chorus]
Uh oh uh oh
Sometimes I go crazy
Uh oh uh oh
Watch me Watch me
Uh oh uh oh
Sometimes I go crazy[Justin Timberlake:]
Break it down
I hear voices in my head
they go oh oh oh[x6][Rihanna:]
I got a hole in my head
A hole in my head
Sometimes I get crazy and
I ain't scared of nobody
Don't look at me funny
Did you hear what I said
I gotta hole in my head
Ay ay ay I gotta hole in my head
Ay ay ay I gotta hole in my head
Don't look at me funny
Like you ain't heard what I said
Ay ay ay I gotta hole in my head[Justine Timberlake:]
You got a hole in your head
You got a hole in your head girl
You got a hole in your head
You got a hole in your head girl
You got a hole in your head
You got a hole in your head girl

Feels so good being bad
There's no way I'm turning back
Now the pain is my pleasure
Cause nothing could measure
Love is great, love is fine
Out the box, out of line
The affliction of the feeling
Leaves me wanting more[Chorus x2:]
Cause I may be bad
But I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air

You're just waiting on the traffic jam to finish, girl
The things we could do in twenty minutes girl
Say my name, say my name
Wear it out, it's getting hot, crack a window, air it out
I can get you through a mighty long day
Soon as you go the text that I write is gonna say[Rihanna]
Not everybody knows how to work my body
Knows how to make me want it
Boy, you stay up on it
You got that something that keeps me so off balance

Hey boy, I really wanna see if you can go downtown with a girl like me

Back and forth you rock me
So I surrender to every word you whisper
Every door you enter, I will let you in[Chorus]
You're so amazing, you took the time to figure me out
That's why you take me, way past the point of turning me on
You about to break me, I swear you got me losing my mind

You say you love me
But they feel
Like words to me
Well this just
Ain't working
Stop thinking
You can run over me
Drifting
Settling
Off to
A foreign place
If I can't see
What's in front of me
It's a mystery
Well then apparently[Chorus:]
Things just ain't the same
And I'm ready for change
Go on, begone, bye bye, so long
Can't you see that you're
Fading, fading, fading, fading
Away, away, away, away
I opened up my eyes, and I finally realized
Today, today, it's too late
You're fading away
Put a sock in it
Just stop running your mouth
Got my mind made up
I ain't coming back again
No way, no way, no way, no way
Cause I'm so fed up
You got me messed up
If we hooking back up
Don't press your luck today, today
I'm blowing you away[Chorus:]
Things just ain't the same
And I'm ready for a change
Go on, begone, ta ta, so long
Can't you see that you're
Fading, fading, fading, fading
Away, away, away, away
I opened up my eyes and I finally realized
Today, today, it's too late
You're fading away
Saw you turn into a ghost right in front of my eyes
Tell me what's a girl to do when she's crying inside?
I'm about to go insane, I'm jumping off this train
Whether wrong or right I'll be gone by night[Chorus:]
Can't you see that you're
Fading, fading, fading, fading
Away, away, away, away
I opened up my eyes and I finally realized
Today, today, it's too late
You're fading away


La la la la
La la la la
La la la la
(Uh, yeah)
La la la la[Verse 1:]
I want you to love me, like I'm a hot pie
Keep thinkin' of me, doin' what you like
So boy forget about the world cause it's gon' be me and you tonight
I wanna make you beg for it, then I'm a make you swallow your pride

Cause I'm the only one who understands how to make you feel like a man (yeah)
Want you to make me feel like I'm the only girl in the world
Like I'm the only one that you'll ever love

Hold me like a pillow, make me feel right
Baby I'll tell you all my secrets that I'm keepin', you can come inside
And when you enter, you ain't leavin', be my prisoner for the night[Chorus:]
Want you to make me feel like I'm the only girl in the world

Chest to chest
Nose to nose
Palm to palm
We were always just that close
Wrist to wrist
Toe to toe
Lips that felt just like the inside of a rose
So, how come when I reach out my finger
It feels like more than distance between us
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart for me
My California king
Eye to eye
Cheek to cheek
Side by side
You were sleeping next to me
Arm in arm
Dusk to dawn
With the curtains drawn
And a little last night on these sheets
So, how come when I reach out my fingers
It seems like more than distance between us
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart for me
My California king
Just when I felt like giving up on us
You turned around and gave me one last touch
That made everything feel better
And even then my eyes got wetter
So confused wanna ask you if you love me
But I don't wanna seem so weak
Maybe I've been California dreaming
Yeah yeah yeah
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart for me
My California king
My California king
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart for me
My California king


I didn't mean to end his life
I know it wasn't right
I can't even sleep at night
Can't get it off my mind
I need to get out of sight
Before I end up behind bars
What started out as a simple altercation
Turned into a real sticky situation
Me just thinking on the time that I'm facing
Makes me wanna cry
Cause I didn't mean to hurt him
Could've been somebody's son
And I took his heart when
I pulled out that gun
Rum, pum, pum rum, pum, pum, pum rum, pum, pum, pum
Man Down
Rum, pum, pum, pum rum, pum, pum, pum rum, pum, pum, pum
Man Down

Oh, why? Oh, why?
Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In central station
It's a 22
I Call her Peggy Sue
When she fits right down in my shoes
What you expect me to do
If you're playing me for a fool
I will lose my cool
And reach for my fire arm
I didn't mean to lay him down
But it's too late to turn back now
Don't know what I was thinking
Now he's no longer living
So I'm ‘bout to leave town (yeah)
Cause I didn't mean to hurt him
Could've been somebody's son
And I took his heart when
I pulled out that gun
Rum, pum, pum, pum rum, pum, pum, pum rum, pum, pum, pum
Man Down
Rum, pum, pum, pum rum, pum, pum, pum rum, pum, pum, pum
Man Down
Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In central station
In front of a big ol' crowd
Oh, why? Oh, why?
Oh, mama, mama, mama

In central station
And I never thought I'd do it
Never thought I'd do it
Never thought I'd do it
Oh, gosh

Pull the trigger, pull the trigger – boom

[Rihanna]
On the first page of our story
The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
I don’t know why I’m still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you’ll always be my hero
Even though you’ve lost your mind[Chorus:]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that’s all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that’s all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Oh, I love the way you lie[Rihanna]
Now there’s gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war you’ll always win
Even when I’m right
‘Cause you feed me fables from your hand
With violent words and empty threats
And it’s sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied[Chorus][Rihanna]
So maybe I’m a masochist
I try to run but I don’t wanna ever leave
'Til the walls are goin’ up
In smoke with all our memories[Eminem]
It's morning, you wake, a sun ray hits your face
Smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction
Hush baby, speak softly, tell me you're awfully sorry
That you pushed me into the coffee table last night
So I can push you off me
Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me
Run out the room and I’ll follow you like a lost puppy
Baby, without you I’m nothing, I’m so lost, hug me
Then tell me how ugly I am, but that you’ll always love me
Then after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the
Destructive path that we’re on, two psychopaths but we
Know that no matter how many knives we put in each other’s backs
That we’ll have each other’s backs, ’cause we’re that lucky
Together, we move mountains, let’s not make mountains out of molehills,
You hit me twice, yeah, but who’s countin’?
I may have hit you three times, I’m startin’ to lose count
But together, we’ll live forever, we found the youth fountain
Our love is crazy, we’re nuts, but I refuse counsellin’
This house is too huge, if you move out I’ll burn all two thousand
Square feet of it to the ground, ain’t shit you can do about it
'Cause with you I’m in my fuckin’ mind, without you I’m out it[Chorus]
I love the way you lie [3x]

My love is your love, your love is mine[Bridge]
And Yes I'm kinda crazy,
That's what happens baby,
When you put it down
You shouldn't give it to me
Good like that,
Shouldn't hit it like that,
Had me yellin' like that
Didn't know you would've had me coming back
You the one that I'm feeling
You the one that I'm loving
Ain't no other niggas like you
No there's just one, one, one
One, one, one
No baby just one, one, one

[Narration:]
It's like you're screaming, and no one can hear
You almost feel ashamed
That someone could be that important
That without them, you feel like nothing
No one will ever understand how much it hurts
You feel hopeless; like nothing can save you
And when it's over, and it's gone
You almost wish that you could have all that bad stuff back
So that you could have the good
Yellow diamonds in the light
Now we’re standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive
It’s the way I’m feeling I just can’t deny
But I’ve gotta let it go
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
Shine a light through an open door
Love and life I will divide
Turn away 'cause I need you more
Feel the heartbeat in my mind
It’s the way I’m feeling I just can’t deny
But I’ve gotta let it go
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
Yellow diamonds in the light
Now we’re standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine (mine, mine, mine)
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

Mama, I found a man
Who loves me and understands
Papa, he’s quite a man
He adores me, he’s my biggest fan
And don't get me wrong,
I know he’s not perfect in your eyes
But somehow he’s flawless in mine
And you may tell me to run, run now
But I can't do that
We're too far down the hole
He's got a hold on my soul
So I guess I'm a fool
I'm a fool in love
But I'm willing to stay here
And bask in the glory of his heart
I guess I'm a fool in love
But I'm willing to look so stupid
Till I've had enough
Mama, don't judge me now
I'm not trying to hurt you
I know this won't make you proud
Papa, did I let you down?
Are you ashamed of how your little girl turned out?
You'll see a monster
I see a smile
You say it's danger
And I'm in denial
But somehow I feel so safe right now
So I guess I'm a fool
I'm a fool in love
But I'm willing to stay here
And bask in the glory of his heart
I guess I'm a fool in love
But I'm willing to look so stupid
Till I've had enough


Yellow diamonds in the light
Now we’re standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive
It’s the way I’m feeling I just can’t deny
But I’ve gotta let it go
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
Shine a light through an open door
Love a life I will divide
Turn away 'cause I need you more
Feel the heartbeat in my mind
It’s the way I’m feeling I just can’t deny
But I’ve gotta let it go
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
Yellow diamonds in the light
Now we’re standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

I've been ignoring this big lump in my throat
I shouldn't be crying,
tears were for the weaker days
I'm stronger now, or so I say,
But something's missing
Whatever it is,
it feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is,
it's just laughing at me
And I just wanna scream
What now? I just can't figure it out
What now? I guess I'll just wait it out (wait it out)
What now? Oh, oh, oh, oh! What now?
I found the one, he changed my life
But was it me that changed
And he just happened to come at the right time
I'm supposed to be in love
But I'm numb again
Whatever it is,
it feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is,
it's just sitting there laughing at me
And I just wanna scream
What now? I just can't figure it out
What now? I guess I'll just wait it out (wait it out)
What now? Please tell me
What now?
There's no one to call 'cause I'm just playing games with them all
The more I swear I'm happy, the more that I'm feeling alone
'Cause I spent every hour just going through the motions
I can't even get the emotions to come out
Dry as a bone, but I just wanna shout
What now? I just can't figure it out
What now? I guess I'll just wait it out (wait it out)
What now? Somebody tell me
What now?
I don't know where to go
I don't know what to feel
I don't know how to cry
I don't know oh oh why
I don't know where to go
I don't know what to feel
I don't know how to cry
I don't know oh oh why
I don't know where to go
I don't know what to feel
I don't know how to cry
I don't know oh oh why
So what now?


[Rihanna:]
All along it was a fever
A cold sweat hot-headed believer
I threw my hands in the air, said, "Show me something, "
He said, "If you dare, come a little closer."
Round and around and around and around we go
Oh now, tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know.
Not really sure how to feel about it.
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you.
It takes me all the way.
I want you to stay[Mikky:]
It's not much of a life you're living
It's not just something you take-it's given
Round and around and around and around we go
Oh now, tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know.
Not really sure how to feel about it.
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you.
Yeah, it takes me all the way.
I want you to stay.[Both:]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, the reason I hold on
Ooh, ooh, ooh, the sun need this hole gone
Funny you're the broken one but I'm the only one who needed saving
'Cause when you never see the light it's hard to know which one of us is caving.[Rihanna:]
Not really sure how to feel about it.
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you.
Yeah, it takes me all the way.
I want you to stay, stay.
I want you to stay, oooh.

Red lipstick, rose petals, heartbreak
I was his Marilyn Monroe
Brown eyes, tuxedo, fast cars
A James Dean on the low,
Dean on the low
I ask you what's the matter
You say, oh it's nothing at all
Heart's racing, outta control
And you knew that I couldn't let it go
You used to be this boy I loved
And I used to be this girl of your dreams
Who knew the course of this one drive
Injured us fatally
You took the best years of my life
I took the best years of your life
Felt like love struck me in the night
I pray that love don't strike twice
Red lipstick, rose petals, heartbreak
I was his Marilyn Monroe
Brown eyes, tuxedo, fast cars
A James Dean on the low
What's love without tragedy
What's love without tragedy (Marilyn Monroe)
What's love without tragedy
What's love without tragedy

What am I supposed to do with this heart
How do I take it off if I love it on it's like a work of art
In love we all will fall but we fell a little harder
What am I supposed to do with this heart?
It may be wrong but it feels right to be lost in paradise

I can see the storm, I can see the sky
I can see the darkness, flashing lights
All my fears gone tonight
Let me stay, I'm lost in paradise
(Bass slap)
How was I to know that my love was delusional?

You saw me on the television, setting fire to all the buildings
Yeah I guess you saw me stealing, but you've no idea what I've been needin'
Talk about when we were children, not the kind of kid that you believe in
You saw me on the television, saw me on the television
But that's just the half of it, yeah you saw the half of it
This is the life I live, and that's just the half of it.
Saw me on the television, hanging out my dirty linen
You're entitled to your own opinion
Sit and shake your head at my decision
I guess the kind of songs that I've been singing
Make it seem as if I'm always winning
But you saw me on a television
Yeah you saw me on a television
But that's just the half of it
You saw the half of it
This is the life I live
And that's just the half of it
Oh you know me I'm the life of the party
Beautiful people surround me
Everybody falling in love
Oh you know me, everybody knows that I'm crazy
Sticks and stones they never break me
And I'm the type that don't give a fuck
And that's just the half of it
You saw the half of it
Yeah this is the life I live
And that's just the half of it
Yeah you saw the half of it
And this is the life I live
You saw the half of it
Only the half of it
Eh, oh, no
You saw me on the television.
Saw me on the television.


There could be a freak accident
There could be a fatal disease
I know we hate to think about it
But this as real as you and me
This as real as you and me
We could all fall down
Before our Saviour could return
I know we hate to think about it
But it's as real as you and me
If I should go
Hold my hand
If I should leave
Darling cover me, please
The earth could quake to ruin
We could drift off in our sleep
I know we hate to think about it
But this as real as you and me
This as real as you and me
The ocean crushed the shore
And take us down forevermore
I know we hate to think about it
But this as real as you and me
If I should go
Hold my hand
If I should leave
Darling cover me, please
I know we hate to think about it
But it's as real as you and me
It's as real as you and me

[Chorus 2x:]
Turn your face towards the sun
Let the shadows fall behind you
Tell a prayer, just carry on
And the shadows will never find you
Lost in the rock and roll
Got lost in a promise of a love I never know
Shadows chase me far from home
I remember when my heart was filled with gold
And you know
I've been burned
I've been burned
I've been burned
You see me lose control
It's not worth
It's not worth
It's not worth
My soul[Chorus]
Lost my faith and trust
You and I know gold don't turn to rust
I still swear that we can reign
Like the kings and queens of better yesterday
Don't you know
I've been burned
I've been burned
I've been burned
You see me lose control
It's not worth
It's not worth
It's not worth
My soul[Chorus]
Where you gonna go
Where you gonna go
Where you gonna run to
When you get to the edge of the night
It's time you face the sky[Chorus 3x]

[ASAP Rocky:]
Pretty motherfucker with the mossberg
Jiggy motherfucker at my concerts
I’m wearin fox furs, rockin oxfords
Eatin oxtails, sippin cockspur
Silly motherfuckers lookin awkward
So much dick ridin that my cock hurt[Pause]... we runnin clockwork
So we got purp, and we got work
Tell Ri-Ri I go Re-retarded
On a remix had to re-record it
On a CD, DVD, and TV, MP3 come see me for it
I go cuckoo for your cookoo, your flying fish is my favorite dish
Won’t hear crickets when I crick it, hit it play games like soccer when we kick it, get it?[Rihanna:]
Suck my cockiness
Lick my persuasion
Eat my words
And then swallow your pride down, down
Place my wants and needs
Over your resistance
And then you come around
You come around
You come around
I want you to be my sex slave
Anything that I desire
Be one with my femin-ay
Set my whole body on fire
Fair maiden Rihanna-gate
Taking over your empire
She may be the queen of hearts
But I’m gonna be the queen of your body parts
No one can do you
The way that I do
Boy I wa-a-ant (Youuuuuu)[Hook x2]
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it
Suck my cockiness
Lick my persuasion
Eat my words
And then swallow your pride down, down
Place my wants and needs
Over your resistance
And then you come around
You come around
You come around
I can be your dominatrix
Just submit to my every order
Enter my diamond matrix
If you want my golden flower
Make me your priority
There’s nothing above my pleasure
She may be the queen of hearts
But I’m gonna be the queen of your body parts
No one can do ya
The way that I do
Boy I wa-a-ant
(Youuuuuuuu)[Hook x2]
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it
Homie don’t beat it like a bullet
Beat my drum drum
Like a drum line boogie
(I love it when you)
Dive head first if you wanna
Sing to my body
Hold me tight mister lover
(I love it when you)
Do it like I do it
Like I said
Keep it up, boy
We can do this all day
Be my Harlem
And me St. Tropez
Never found nobody
That will do it this way
No one can do ya
The way that I do
Boy I wa-a-ant
(Youuuuuu)[Hook x2]


[Kanye West]
We the cause of all commotion
Your mouth running, but where is you going?
What is you smoking, man? That ain't potent
What is you talking, man? That ain't important
Illuminati, high society
We in this party and nobody invited me
We going crazy and I always use my best sense
But it don't matter cause I stay on my fresh prince
Maxin', relaxin', shootin' some pool and
Playing some b-ball outside of the school and
Girls with they top off outside of the pool and
Whips with the drop off outside of the Louvre
You just look stupid to be ignoring
The Delorean parked in front of Armani emporium
And parties at Richie is getting risky
Victoria's Secret show, they miss me
Voices in my head, I need choices in my bed
Ahhh, get out my fucking head
It's just me and my bad bitch
So you can say I'm on my Brad Pitt
Back to the la familia I'm aligned with
Before I betray them I slit my wrists
At the top is just us niggas
Cause I don't really trust niggas
And we made it through the hurricane
So celebrate and light the Mary Jane
We gon' make it, that's on everything
Truest girls get half naked, every spring
They saying, "Hey Kanye
We need you to go deeper than Tay Zonday,"
Cause my verses got pain, Chocolate Rain
So many lines, you photograph and it make arms break
On the radio, man I miss myself
I need to just step back and kiss myself
Baby, just step up and kiss the belt
A little lower... that's what's up
Somebody pour her another cup
Is it too much to ask you keep your diamonds up?
I swear until my time is up
My style is sex in the shower, fresh as fuck[Rihanna]
So shine bright, tonight, you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye, so alive
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Palms rise to the universe
As we, moonshine and molly
Feel the warmth, we'll never die
We're like diamonds in the sky
You're a shooting star I see
A vision of ecstasy
When you hold me, I'm alive
We're like diamonds in the sky
I knew that we'd become one right away
Oh, right away
At first sight I felt the energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes
So shine bright, tonight, you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye, so alive
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
So shine bright, tonight, you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye, so alive
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond


[Akon]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Ey[Rihanna]
I was picking up your clothes in the closet (closet)
I was about to throw your jeans in the washer (washer)
Till I saw a piece of paper saying Tasha (Tasha)
I gotta say I found this a bit shocking (shocking)
It’s on receipts here to say you went shopping (shopping)
You bought some Nike shoes
But why you buying stockings?
Boy how could you lie to me
Thought you would die for me
I’m not accepting another apology
After 3 years, I'ma let it go
can't stand around crying no more
Got your bags packed sitting by the door
I'ma leave your heart broken on the floor
You’re gonna be in the emergency room
I’m standing by your bed
and so tempted to pull out your IV
You’re gonna be in the emergency room
I’m fighting with myself
I can’t hurt you even though you hurt me
You’re gonna be in the emergency room
Trying to call a nurse but nobody can help you now
Let me see you try to live without me
Now where’s your heartbeat
Flat line on the EKG
I was home late at night watching TV
Got a call from my girl saying RiRi
Saw your man in the club
I thought he was out of town doing business said he’d be back in three weeks
And now I’m mad
Sitting in the kitchen getting sad
Looking at your pictures
Boy, How could you lie to me
Thought you would die for me
I’m not accepting another apology
After 3 years, I’ma let it go
can't stand around crying no more
Got your bags packed sitting by the door
I’ma leave your heart broken on the floor
You’re gonna be in the emergency room
I’m standing by your bed
and so tempted to pull out your IV
You’re gonna be in the emergency room
I’m fighting with myself
I can’t hurt you even though you hurt me
You’re gonna be in the emergency room
Trying to call a nurse but nobody can help you now
Let me see you try to live without me
Now where’s your heartbeat
Flat line on the EKG[Akon]
I did you wrong, girl
Had a bunch of numbers in my phone, girl (I did)
But we been in this relationship too long, girl
For you to be listening to your silly home girls
Better go on, girl
Now baby think about it (think about it)
Everything we do they gonna read about it (read about it)
Put it on a radio and TV outlet
Do you want to see your picture in that paper
You know them haters
You hear that 808
The drum, that’s my heart beat
I’m going numb, I said Rihanna, I’m feeling stressed
I’m going under cardiac arrest[Rihanna]
You’re gonna be in the emergency room
I’m standing by your bed
and so tempted to pull out your IV
You’re gonna be in the emergency room
I’m fighting with myself
I can’t hurt you even though you hurt me
You’re gonna be in the emergency room
Trying to call a nurse but nobody can help you now
Let me see you try to live without me
Now where’s your heart beat
Flat line on the EKG
Flat line on the EKG


[Verse 1 - Rihanna:]
I think I've had enough
I might get a little drunk
I say what's on my mind
I might do a little time
'Cause all of my kindness
Is taken for weakness[Hook - Rihanna:]
Now I'm Four Five Seconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm just tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
Ooh, that's all I want[Verse 2 - Kanye West:]
Woke up an optimist
Sun was shinin', I'm positive
Then I heard you was talkin' trash
Hold me back, I'm 'bout to spaz[Hook - Rihanna and Kanye West:]
Yeah I'm 'bout Four Five Seconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would drive me
Ooh, that's all I want[Bridge - Rihanna:]
And I know that you're up tonight
Thinkin', "How could I be so selfish?"
But you called 'bout a thousand times
Wondering where I've been
Now I know that you're up tonight
Thinkin', "How could I be so reckless?"
But I just can't apologize
I hope you can understand[Verse 3 - Kanye West:]
If I go to jail tonight
Promise you'll pay my bail
See they want to buy my pride
But that just ain't up for sale[Rihanna and Kanye West:]
See all of my kindness
Is taken for weakness[Hook - Rihanna and Kanye West:]
Now I'm Four Five Seconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
Ooh, that's all I want
Four Five Seconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
Just tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
'Cause that's all I want


[Verse 1:]
I rest my hand across your lips 
Feel your breath by my fingertips 
No longer can I delay what is right 
But this love it wont give up without a fight 
Id write a note and tear it up 
There are no words that could say enough 
I know I'm gonna hurt you when l walk out that door 
But I swear its gonna hurt me even more [Chorus:] 
You taught me how to laugh 
You taught me how to cry 
When I gave up you even taught me how to try 
There's one more thing to learn before I spread my wings and fly 
You gonna have to teach me how to say 
Goodbye, goodbye [Verse 2:]
Wish I could see your dreams tonight 
Wish I could make them turn out right 
Tempted to turn back for just one last kiss 
But my heart tells me its better just like this 
So this is how the story ends 
When love is gone you cant pretend 
No matter who else I give my heart to 
There's a part of it that still belongs to you [Chorus:] 
You taught me how to laugh 
You taught me how to cry 
When I gave up you even taught me how to try 
There's one more thing to learn before I spread my wings and fly 
You gonna have to teach me how to say 
Goodbye, goodbye [Bridge:]
You made me strong when I was weak 
Gave my heart a voice to speak 
You mustve known this day will come 
When the lessons are all done
All except for one, no [Chorus:] 
You taught me how to laugh 
You taught me how to cry 
When I gave up you even taught me how to try 
There's one more thing to learn before I spread my wings and fly 
You gonna have to teach me how to say 
Goodbye 
You gonna have to teach me how to say 
Goodbye


Just as long it makes you happy
If it makes you happy
Just be happy
Just as long it makes you happy
If it makes you happy
Just be happy
It's like spending (Time with you just)
Doing absolutely nothing
That makes me happy
When your..at work (Puttin' on your)
TV shirt, and I love it
Absolutely love it
It's a smile of a child it's your eyes it's your hair
It's the touch of your skin that gets me there
It's also enticing
Waking up from a nice dream
To a beautiful morning with you by my side
that's nice
Just as long it makes you happy..if it makes you happy
Just be happy
Just as long it makes you happy
If it makes you happy
Just be happy
It's like walking (Threw the sprinklers)
Smelling every flower one by one
Makes me happy
Telling me love me
Showing you love me baby
My pretty baby
It's a smile of a child it's your eyes it's your hair
It's the touch of your skin that gets me there
It's also enticing
Waking up from a nice dream
To a beautiful morning with you by my side
Just as long it makes you happy
If it makes you happy
Just be happy
Just as long it makes you happy
If it makes you happy
Just be happy
It's like saturday
Ohh four day weekend
Hiding and seeking with you
Let me do
Let's do it boy
Just as long it makes you happy
If it makes you happy
Just be happy
Just as long it makes you happy
If it makes you happy
Just be happy
Just as long it makes you happy
If it makes you happy
Just be happy
Just as long it makes you happy
If it makes you happy
Just be happy


Now To Sing her new Recording,
The Beautiful, Miss Rihanna
Now this will be the last time you did me wrong, 
No more laying up in your arms, 
No calling, saying you want me back, 
I'm packing my bags, what you think about that? 
I stayed at home like a good girl do 
But tonight baby you got me sad and blue 
I just heard about the girl in your car, y'all kissing at the bar 
Got me crying, [Chorus:]
Oh, you got me hatin' on the club 
Cause you took my love 
Oh, you took my love 
Now you got me like Woah (Why) 
You got me Hatin' On the Club (Why) 
'Cos You took my love (Why) 
Why'd you have to take my love (Why) 
Woah... 
And you can be mad at me all you want, 
I ain't coming in, I'll be waiting out front, 
Coming out the Door, With your girlfriend, 
You Did me Wrong Boy, Tell me Where our Love went, 
I stayed at home like a good girl do 
But tonight baby you got me sad and blue 
I just heard about the girl in your car, yall kissing at the bar 
Got me crying [Chorus]
Now this is the sound of a broken heart 
There's only one reason why we're apart 
She never would of made it to your car 
If it wasn't for the club, I'd still have my love, (I'd still have my love) 
We would still have us, (We Would Still Have Us) 
I'd still have my love, (I'd Still Have My Love) 
We would still Have Us 
But now we're like Woah,
Oh, you got me hatin' on the club 
You took my love 
Oh, you took my love

Boy, You got her Hatin on the (Ah) 
You got her Hatin 
Boy, You got her Hatin on the (Ah) 
You got her Hatin

Another day, another reminder that your not here with me
I watch the snowflakes falling from the sky then I get lost in memories 
The time we tried to build a snowman
The time we tried to count the stars 
Its crazy how we didn’t know then
That we’d ever be apart
I can hear the music playing 
See the lights upon the tree 
I can feel the joy in every soul 
But for me it’s incomplete
And I try my best to play the part, but no matter what I do
No, it just don’t feel like Christmas without you, you 
Another tear, another regret boy, that you’re so far away 
Can it be that it was only last year we shared that Christmas day
Remember when we took the sleigh ride 
Remember singing by the fire
There’s to much that’s in the daylight
I keep reliving you and I
I can hear the music playing 
See the lights upon the tree 
I can feel the joy in every soul
But for me it’s incomplete
And I try my best to play the part, but no matter what I do
No, it just don’t feel like Christmas without you  
Time we tried to build a snowman
The time we tried to count the stars
Its crazy how we didn’t know then
That we’d ever be apart 
I can hear the music playing
See the lights upon the tree 
I can feel the joy in every soul
But for me it’s incomplete 
And I try my best to play the part, but no matter what I do, 
It just don’t feel like Christmas,
no it just don’t feel like Christmas without you, ooh baby
See I tried but it just ain’t right, right without you.


I'd rather be smoking weed
Whenever we breathe
Everytime you kiss me
Don't say that you miss me
Just come get me
Don't know why just know I want to
Don't know why just know I want you
I'd rather be breaking things
Cause we can't see
We're too busy kissing
Just making scenes
Here come the police
They know about your history
How you live and love like "fuck rules"?
Don't care why, just know I love you


How was I to know that my love was delusional?
Somebody tell me how to mend a broken-hearted soul
In love we all will fall but we fell a little harder
What am I supposed to do with this heart?
It may be wrong but it feels right to be lost in paradise
I'm so lost in paradise (lost in paradise)
If I open up my eyes
I can see the storm, I can see the sky
I can see the darkness, flashing lights
All my fears gone tonight
Let me stay, I'm lost in paradise
(Bass slap)
How was I to know that my love was delusional?

(Bass slap)


I'm painting my smile, drying my tears
Covert it all (covert it all)
You wear disguise, hiding your fears 
Put up a wall
But underneath it all that love we had is gone
We already let go
But we put on a show so nobody knows 
Cause we ain't ready too fall
It's a Masquerade!
We've been trying to hide our faces behind a Masquerade!
Dancing around that truth 
But I don't wanna lie 
I'm tired of pretending
Acting like everything's okay
It hurts to much to face 
It's over, so we keep living in a Masquerade!
Your all that I know, so comfortable
But the feeling is gone
And even though we need more 
We're scared of being alone, so the show goes on
If we took off our mask then we could never last
Cause we'll be force to see
It's all to make be live 
Cause we're not who we use to be
It's a Masquerade!
We've been trying to hide our faces behind a Masquerade!
Dancing around that truth 
But I don't wanna lie 
I'm tired of pretending
Acting like everything's okay
It hurts to much to face 
It's over, so we keep living in a Masquerade!
I'm wiping my smile off
Letting the tears come streaming down
You take your disguise off
Bringing your walls down to the ground
We be screaming inside 
We can finally let it go
The truth is our now
We're face to face 
Time it put it into this
It's a Masquerade!
We've been trying to hide our faces behind a Masquerade!
Dancing around that truth 
But I don't wanna lie 
I'm tired of pretending
Acting like everything's okay
It hurts to much to face 
It's over, so we keep living in a Masquerade!


[Intro: Young Jeezy]
Say, Rih-Rih, let’s take this shit to the street one-time, you know?
Throwin’ hundreds like loose change (still got my money)
Got your broad in that Mulsanne (that Bentley, homie)
Seats whiter than cocaine (that 40 on me)
Got me and Chi-Chi, bring broads, mane
She like my homie[Verse: Young Jeezy]
I’m King Tut with my gold chain
My partner with me, he the dope mane
Straight gassed, nigga, that BP
On that E40, that OG
These bitch niggas be actin’ up
These hoe niggas be actin’ foul
They’ll grind with you, they’ll shine with you
Be pointin’ fingers off at your trial
My Rolls Royce with my driver in it
Gettin’ fucked up ‘cause I ain’t got to drive
Got Kendrick on them bottles
Came and poured a swimming pool and we about to dive
Got one room, got three bitches
And you’re damn right that’s where they’re supposed to be
Two glock .40s at all times
I’ll shoot back if niggas shoot at me, you know it[Hook: Rihanna]
Ohhh…
All I see is signs
All I see is dollar signs
Ohhh…
Money on my mind
Money, money on my mind
Throw it, throw it up
Watch it fall out from the sky
Throw it up, throw it up
Watch it all fall out
Pour it up, pour it up
That’s how we ball out
Throw it up, throw it up
Watch it all fall out
Pour it up, pour it up
That’s how we ball out
That’s how we ball out
That’s how we ball out
That’s how we ball out[Verse: Rick Ross]
My foreign cars – domestic beefs
Peter Luger’s – the better seats
Dollar after dollar – bottle after bottle
Late for you haters even though my plane charter
Suede Bally shoes, true rude boy
Ferrari 400 horses, we do it for cool points
Baby, do the math – I’m coppin’ Chanel bags
Talkin’ Bell Harbour cigars for her mans
Know we run the streets, eatin’ cold bully beef
Now we at the Grammys, Tom Ford to my feet
Boss on the avey, Rihanna screensaver
Whenever you see the fat boy, you know it mean paper[Verse: Juicy J]
Juicy J pourin’ up codeine – Benz all white, no chlorine
Bad chick with me got ass and titties
Freaky bitch gon’ fuck the whole team
Ziplock bag full of OG – I go in like a door key
Your girlfriend on both knees, she catch more balls than a goalie
Purple all in my sprite, I’m high as Denzel on Flight
Scared of money, don’t make no money
You niggas shaky like dice
I’m in the bed with your wife
We poppin’ pills, we goin’ hard
When she with you she a church girl
When she with me she a pornstar
Smokin’ on doobies like cigarettes
Which one of these strippers give head the best?
Pussy so good that I think I’m in love
What am I saying? It must be the drugs
Pour it up, pop that ass out, make it rain, hoe
I’ll make it flood, shorty, you might need a raincoat[Verse: Rihanna]
Strip clubs and dollar bills
Still got more money
Patron shots, can I get a refill?
I still got more money
Strippers goin’ up and down that pole
And I still got my money
Four o’clock and we ain’t going home
Still got more money
Money make the world go around
I still got my money
Bands make your girl go down
Still got more money
Lot more where that came from
Still got more money
The look in your eyes, I you know you want some
Still got more money
Pour it up, pour it up
That’s how we ball out
That’s how we ball out
That’s how we ball out
That’s how we ball out[Verse: T.I.]
I catch a case and I go to jail (still got more money)
I came home and went back over there (still got more money)
I’m multiplying everything I spend (still got more money)
These trap niggas I represent (still got more money)
It’s Hustle Gang and we poppin’
Got big bank rolls in our pockets
Hoppin’ out a foregin vehicle
Throwin’ forty Gs, ain’t no issue, bitch, bitch!
I’m thorough as it get, official, bitch, bitch!
Better watch your pussy poppin’
I might wanna come and get you, bitch
Now everywhere you may see me
Surrounded by bad bitches like Rih-Rih
Got them booty shots, look like Nicki
Face and toes pretty, I’m picky
See these trap niggas, they on to me
And these rap niggas up under me
Ain’t nothin’ for me to get a hundred keys
And then stimulate the economy, like…[Hook]


Now you got me on my own
And I don't want to ever go
Now we're both alone
Don't think I'll ever want to go
Don't tell me you don't want it (want it)

Just let 'em all just say what they wanna say
That's how I feel, cause I'm in love
And the temperature just heats up
When I'm with you, don't be scared
When I start to go down and I lick you
Rubbin' and kissin' and lickin' on your body
When I go down and oh I'm gon' miss you
Gonna need your body right now
Cause I know it's an issue
And I'm hyperventilating right now
I can't breathe, If I ain't with you
I need your body like right now

Do what you wanna, take command
I'm about to be your biggest fan
Your property, treat me like I'm your property
Do what you wanna, take command
I'm about to be your biggest fan[Hook][Chris Brown & Rihanna:]
Looking for too many places
Searching high and low for you
I'm stronger when I'm close to you
I'm seeing all familiar faces
Girl it's all about you, only you in my life
And I say, "You like playing with my heart?"
Baby, please don't do this to me
Cause I'm in love
Can I get a little bit? One more kiss?
Yeah I don't wanna miss it[Hook]


All the pirates, yeah, they rob them
Sold them on to the merchant ship
Minutes after they took them
From the bottomless pit
But their hand was made strong
By the hand of the Almighty
They flourished in this generation
Triumphantly
Won't you help me sing
These songs of freedom?
'Cause all I ever have
Redemption song
Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery
None but ourselves can free our minds
Have no fear of atomic power
'Cause nothing can stem the tide
How long will they kill our prophets
While we stand aside and look?
Some say it's all a part of it
We've got to fulfill the book
Won't you help me sing
These songs of freedom?
'Cause all I ever have
Redemption song
Won't you help me sing
These songs of freedom?
'Cause all we ever have
Redemption song
All we ever have
Redemption song
All we'll ever have
Redemption song
All we'll ever have
Redemption song
Redemption song

There’s no way I’m turning back
Now the pain is my pleasure
Cause nothing could measure
Love is great, love is fine
Out the box, out of line
The affliction of the feeling
Leaves me wanting more[Chorus]
Cause I may be bad
But I’m perfectly good at it
Sex in the air
I don’t care
I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones
May break my bones
But chains and whips
Excite me

Feel the pain on your skin
Tough, I don't scream mercy
It's your time to hurt me
Yeah
If I'm bad tie me down
Shut me up, gag and bound me
Cos the pain is my pleasure
Nothing comes better
Yeah[Chorus:]
Cause I may be bad
But I’m perfectly good at it
Sex in the air
I don’t care
I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones
May break my bones
But chains and whips

Hey, you know they say pain is pleasure
Turn this up when you play this shit
One time for my latest girl
You can be one of my greatest hits
Tired of rapping ’bout chains and whips
Do you like to get chained and whipped
Do you like rough sex, hit em like I’m upset
Do they get your panties wet
Let, let, lets go, you rocking with Cole, it’s the best flow
With the game on lock while them lamo’s watch
I’m on fire, they are not
I kick down the door, they all knock
Bitch I’m a boss, they on a clock
You used to be a good girl, don’t matter
Since you got bad, you only got badder[Chorus]
‘Cause I may be bad, but I’m perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don’t care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones,
But chains and whips excite me.
Na-na-na come on, come on

Overnight oh
Overnight oh
I wish the pain would go away
I wish they'd find a cure today
I asked the doctor what it means
He says things ain't as bad as what they seem
My heart is working over time
To me it's broke inside
And this heart it needs to see the light
Cause I'm stuck
At least that's what it feels like
I'm slower to heal
Slower to heal
Don't wanna feel the way I feel
Wish I could kill this pain that I feel
But it don't happen that way, at all
It's not gon happen overnight, overnight, overnight
I won't get better overnight, overnight, overnight
It's not gon happen overnight, overnight, overnight
I won't get better overnight, overnight, overnight
So I'm slower to heal
It's like I'm in a traffic jam
Need to put out a good exam
I'm like a newly penitry
I wish you could find it in yourself
To be patient with me
I'm slower to heal
Slower to heal
Don't wanna feel the way I feel
Wish I could kill this pain that I feel
But it don't happen that way, never
It's not gon happen overnight, overnight, overnight
I won't get better overnight, overnight, overnight
It's not gon happen overnight, overnight, overnight
I won't get better overnight, overnight, overnight
I'm slower to heal
Slower to heal
Don't wanna feel the way I feel
Wish I could kill this pain that I feel
But it don't happen that way, never[x2]
It's not gon happen overnight, overnight, overnight
I won't get better overnight, overnight, overnight
It's not gon happen overnight, overnight, overnight
I won't get better overnight, overnight, overnight[x2]


[Jay-Z - Chorus]
When the sky falls and the Earth quakes
We gon put this back together
We won’t break[repeat][Jay-Z]
Sa Pa Sé, my Port-Au-Princes
My Haitian Gods and all of my Princesses
Our condolences as you fightin’ against this
We’re right by your side as we tryin’ to make sense of this
Heavenly father help us see through these problems
And for those that left, accept them into your garden
So here’s my theory, the country’s already starvin’
So we sacrificed many to shed light on all of them
God please pardon, I speak from the heart
It's the only way I see this tragedy befall on them
So lets get involved with them, hand to hand with them
Arm to arm with them til' they get strong again,
When the sky falls...[Rihanna and Bono – Hook]
Can’t wait until tomorrow
Haiti, Mon Amour
Haiti, Mon Amour
Not gonna leave you stranded, alone, alone
oh no[Chorus][Jay-Z Verse 2]
Learn from the past, New Orleans was flooded
So we know we just can’t rely on the government
We under the rubble again, here we go rumbling when
When we gon catch a break, my friend lost his mother and then
And then, Carline lost her uncles and them
Buried with no caskets, they just put covers on them
And the tears fall, and we fight back
Story ain’t done, it can’t end like that
Nah not like this, tomorrow’s survivors gonna carry on your name
You live on inside us, your memory’s alive with us
You inspired us, to rebuild this country, you just guide us[Hook][Bono]
It’s not the angels that are on their way
It's not the bells of Santa Trinite
The people waiting, positions vacant
For hands to help, not just to pray[Hook][French singing]
Haïti va s’élever
Tu vas te relever
Nous nous éléverons
Ensemble ensemble ensemble
(not gonna leave you stranded...)[Jay-Z]
We gon put this back together we won't break
We gon put this back together we won't break
We gon put this back together we won't break
We gon put this back together we won't break

Million dollar voice, came through the phone
We heading to the top, if you coming, come on
I’m Flying out to Pisa, just to get some pizza

I stepped in the dance
Looking for you
That's when
I felt you on my shoulder
The red light came on
And I knew it
Time to wine down
And find ourselves a corner
Six pack with braids and green eyes
I told myself
Girl damn he's too fly
His jeans fit just right
With the nice lean
Tell him upclose
Now let's sing the chorus
If you like what you see
Then you have to let me know
Put your hand pon it
And then we dip it low
Tip pon toe
Now it's time to wine it slow (wining it slow now)
If you like what you see
Then you have to let ma know
Put your hand her ma back
And pull her in close
Tip pon toe
Wheel it back now here we go
Here we go now
I cannot front
I've been on you
The way that you move
Makes me light blue
If you keep talking like that in my ear
I'm about to put it on you I swear
Torn apart this basement
And go somewhere and kick it
It's getting crowded and it's hot
So tell me are you with it
But there will be no hitting
Wait hold up let me finish
I've got something for you
If you like what you see
Then you have to let me know
Put your hand pon it
And then we dip it low
Tip pon toe
Now it's time to wine it slow (Oooohhh)
If you like what you see
Then you have to let ma know
Put your hand pon her back
And pull her in close

Ahuh Ahuh (Yea Rihanna, Chris Brown)
Ahuh Ahuh (Good girl gone bad)
Ahuh Ahuh (Take three... Action)
Ahuh Ahuh
No clouds in my storms
Let it rain, I hydroplane in the bank
Coming down with the Dow Jones
When the clouds come we gone, we Rocafella
We fly higher than weather
And G5's are better, You know me,
an anticipation, for precipitation. Stacked chips for the rainy day
Jay, Rain Man is back with little Ms. Sunshine
Rihanna where you at?[Rihanna]
You have my heart
And we'll never be worlds apart
May be in magazines
But you'll still be my star
Baby cause in the dark
You can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you I'll always share
Because[Chorus]
When the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be a friend
Took an oath I'ma stick it out till the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella ella ella eh eh eh
Under my umbrella ella ella eh eh eh
Under my umbrella ella ella eh eh eh
Under my umbrella ella ella eh eh eh eh eh eh[Chris Brown]
You're becoming a dream to me
Fairytale fantasy
Nothing can ever compare
An image to my memory
Girl I'm asking could you be my queen?
A vision on a magazine
That's when I'll be there
It's something we both share
Because[Chorus - Chris Brown]
When the sun shine, we'll shine together
You know I'll be here forever
Although it's a lot of rain outside
Girl it's getting late you can stay the night
But you can dipout anytime whenever
I can call a car I ain't tryna stress ya
I'm looking for the one with the glass slipper
Baby girl you can be my Cinderella ella ella eh eh eh
You can be my Cinderella ella ella eh eh eh
You can be my Cinderella ella ella eh eh eh
You can be my Cinderella ella ella eh eh eh eh eh eh[Both]
You can run into my arms
It's okay don't be alarmed
Come into me
There's no distance in between our love
So go on and say my name some more
I'll be all you need and more (ah.. ready?)
Because[Chorus]
When the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be a friend
Took an oath I'ma stick it out till the end
But you can dip out anytime whenever
I can call a car I ain't tryna stress ya
I'm looking for the one with the glass slipper
Baby girl you can be my Cinderella ella ella eh eh eh
Under my umbrella ella ella eh eh eh
You can be my Cinderella ella ella eh eh eh
Under my umbrella ella ella eh eh eh eh eh eh
It's raining (rainin')
Ooh baby it's raining (rainin')

Oh baby it's raining (Rihanna)
You can always some into me

I just met infatuation
it's something in his smile
Your my obsession .... you and I
Something takes over, pulls me up onto my feet
Before I know it I got you pushing up on me
On the floor
Under the burning lights
I'm screaming look behind
Hands on this waist of mine
And I don't know where this will lead
But I'm hoping you tell me
Out here whipping my hair all crazy, baby
Doin' it like I'm at work
I'm making that thang jump
I'm making that thang twirk (so get up on it baby)
I'm doin what I do
I make it move
Got me out here whipping my hair awww
Baby, I just might have what you need
Sprinkling you with pieces of me
Now lets make it a sight to see, baby
On the floor
Under the burning lights
I'm screaming look behind
hands on this waist of mine.
And I don't know where this will lead
But I'm hoping you tell me
out her whipping my hair all crazy, baby
Doin it like I'm at work
I'm making that thang jump
I'm making that thang twirk (so get up on it baby)
I'm doin what I do

Got me whipping my hair, awww
We flashing pictures
Kodak moment memory
Look at the flickers
Sparks on my camera screen
The buried treasure
Come with me and we will find
Create a perfect world just for you and I
On the floor
Burning lights
Screaming look behind
Hands on this waist of mine
And I don't know where this will lead
But I'm hoping you tell me
Out her whipping my hair all crazy, baby
Doin it like I'm at work
I'm making that thang jump
I'm making that thang twirk
so get up on it baby

Baby, I just might have what you need
Sprinkling you with pieces of me

[Verse 1:]
Feel the adrenaline moving under my skin
It's an addiction such an eruption
Sound is my remedy feeding me energy
Music is all I need[Pre-Chorus:]
Baby, I just wanna dance
I don't really care
I just wanna dance
I don't really care, care, care (feel it in the air yeah)[Chorus:]
She's a mean-eyed crazy addicted disco diva and you wonder
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?
Too cold for you to keep her
Too hot for you to leave her
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?[Verse 2]
Back on the dance floor better not to take me home
Bass kicking so hard blazing through my beating heart
French kissing on the floor, party's gettin' hardcore
Everybody's getting a little tipsy off the crazy juice
This will end up on the news[Pre-Chorus:]
Baby, I just wanna dance
I don't really care
I just wanna dance
I don't really care, care, care (feel it in the air yeah)[Chorus:]
She's a mean-eyed crazy addicted disco diva and you wonder
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?
Too cold for you to keep her
Too hot for you to leave her
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?[Bridge:]
Ultra-sexual, the night has got me love sprung
I won't stop until the sun is up oh yeah
My heart is a dancer beating like a disco drum
Oh, oh oh, oh wohh, oh oh
Ultra-sexual, the night has got me love sprung
I won't stop until the sun is up oh yeah
My heart is a dancer beating like a disco drum
Beating like a disco drum

She's a mean and crazy addicted, disco diva and you wonder
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?
Too cold for you to keep her
Too hot for you to leave her
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?
