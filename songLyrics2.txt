It's been a minute since I saw you boy
Must admit it's good to hear your voice
And I guess that I forgot just how you make me feel when your around
See you haven't lost your sense of style
And you still could melt me with your smile
Can't deny that I still got these feelin' deep inside[Hook]
It's funny how things could change
But still remain the same
Isn't love just a crazy game
Baby here I go again[Chorus]
I look into your eyes and then
My heart remembers when
And I realize I neva gotten over you
Everytime I hear your name
It's like the sun shined through the rain
And I realize it's happening
Baby here I go again
Here I Go Again[Verse 2]
Still remember how you make me weak
How I fought to find the words to speak
I just cant excape the memories
I tried but I just cant break free
Thought I closed the door on what we had
But these feelings just keep comin back
Didn't think that you could make me loose control like that[Hook]
Sweet lovin' is my ting
So you know mi got fi swing
That's why yuh request it again
Without a doubt yuh want to spend
And to experience it again
Because yuh love the way yuh felt back then
So make me light it up again
Reignite the flames again
'Cause you really miss 'dem days when we used to chill
Up on the hill watch the sun set in West Nigril
Girl yuh Bajan beauty it a gimme di chill
Not to mention the way you are within[Chorus]


I want to let you know
That you don't have to go
Don't wonder no more
What I think about you
If it's loving that you want
Then you should make me your girl, your girl
If it's loving that you need
Baby come and share my world, share my world
If it's loving that you want
Then come and take a walk with me, walk with me
Cause, everything that you need, I got it right here baby, baby
Now it's obvious you need a friend to come hold you down
Be that one you share your everything when no one's around
Baby come tell me your secrets, and tell me all your dreams
'Cause I can see you need someone to trust
You can trust in me
Di di di di da da dey
So just call me whenever your lonely

A game that I know all to well now
Well I use to  buy your lines
But it's time for me to sail now[Chorus][Rap]
First you tellin me no
But please tell me yes

Straight up tell me yes
Gimme the keys to ya chest
Ya chest will rise neva rest

Hey Rihanna 
Your lovin really put me to the test
But if you shoulda let me soon the answer will yes
Yes to this yes to that yes to whateva you suggest
So please say yes
No no no[Verse 2]
Haters gonna hate

I found out much to late
I think I know were a little hot now
The truth leads to the lies
The heart aint always right
And I see that love is blind now
Boy you use to have my trust
Without no trust there aint no us boy[Chorus]

Once was a time you and I
Made a promise till the day we die
I trusted each and every word
Never thinking that I'd get burned
Silly me I believed in your fairy tales
Boy I thought that I knew you so very well
But you walked on my pride all the tears that I cried
And it cuts like a knife[Hook"]
It's the last time you're ever gonna kiss these lips
Or ever will deceive these eyes
Believe me when I tell you this
Baby boy it's the last time
I'm ever gonna cry these tears
I'm never gonna hear your lies
So listen while I make it clear
In case you didn't hear
This time's the last time
There's no time
To give it one more try
There's only time to say goodbye
Fooled me once shame on you
Fooled me twice now this song is through
The things you said I can never forget
The things you did fill my heart with regret
But I'm still standing tall as I walk away
And you know that it's true when you hear me say
It's over, it's through,
Ain't a thing you can do boy, its' sad but it's true[Hook:]
It's the last time you're ever gonna kiss these lips
Or ever will deceive these eyes
Believe me when I tell you this
Baby boy it's the last time
I'm ever gonna cry these tears
I'm never gonna hear your lies
So listen while I make it clear
In case you didn't hear
This time's the last time
There's no time
To give it one more try
There's only time to say goodbye
Good Bye No Baby
Silly me I believed in your fairy tales
Boy I thought that I knew you so very well
But you walked on my pride all the tears that I cried
And it cuts... like a knife[Hook:]
It's the last time you're ever gonna kiss these lips (ever gonna kiss these lips)
Or ever will deceive these eyes
Believe me when I tell you this
Baby boy it's the last time
I'm ever gonna cry these tears
I'm never gonna hear your lies (never gonna hear your lies)
So listen while I make it clear
In case you didn't hear
This time's the last time
There's no time
To give it one more try
It's over, it's through
Ain't a thing you can do but wonder why
There's only time to say goodbye
Baby goodbye
Never gonna, never gonna cry no more
Goodbye, goodbye

Gotta keep it on the down low
I'll never let my mama know
Only call him on my cell phone, only see him after dark
I met him on the 6 train, just the way he said my name
The brotha had a lot a game, had me open from the start
He scoops me up in his ride, Friday about a quarter to 9
So fly and so fine, and I'm so glad that he's all mine[Hook] There's a thug in my life, how'ma gonna tell my mama
She gonna say it ain't right, but he's so good to me
There's a thug in my life, and its gonna cause crazy drama
I'm gonna see him tonight, I'm gonna give him everything
I know his crew is kinda shady
Sometimes it gets kinda crazy
But he treats me like a lady, gives me everything I need
I don't care who's hating on me, 'cause every night he's waiting on me
He's got mad personality, a side they never see
My friends tell me to slow down, but everytime that he's around
My heart's on lock down, I feel love and I'm so proud[Hook]
There's a thug in my life, how'ma gonna tell my mama
She gonna say it ain't right, but he's so good to me
There's a thug in my life, and its gonna cause crazy drama
I'm gonna see him tonight, I'm gonna give him everything[Rap]
T-H-U-G in ya life baby
One in a million thats what you are to me
And I know your friends say I'm rough
But I still got that tender touch just to make u giggle and blush
But ya mom does not approve of us
She needs to be a lot more understanding
'Cause all I have for you is thug loving and loving thats all I'm giving[Bridge]
Mama, don't worry, I'm not in a hurry
I wont disappoint you, I wont make you sorry
He's the one for me (He's all I ever need)
We'll be together from now till forever
I know its the real thing, if you don't whatever
And I know its meant to be[Hook]
There's a thug in my life, how'ma gonna tell my mama
She gonna say it ain't right, but he's so good to me
There's a thug in my life, and its gonna cause crazy drama
I'm gonna see him tonight, I'm gonna give him everything[Bridge]
Mama, don't worry, I'm not in a hurry
I wont disappoint you, I wont make you sorry


[Verse 1:]
Took a chance, roll the dice of me and you
Opened up, let you in my world
Like a dance, started slow and then love took control
Swept away, so proud to be your girl
When you write a story much to fast
Sometimes a happy ending doesn’t last[Chorus:]
Now I know that love ain’t meant to be a play thing
Now I know it’s not an ordinary everyday thing
Now I know that when it's right it's so amazing
When it’s wrong you gotta let it go
Now I know
Now I know[Verse 2:]
Remember when, we said our love would last forever
But then again, how are we to know
There come a time, that love will change like stormy weather
A sunny day will suddenly turn cold
Time will teach you all you need to learn
But there’ll always be a first time you get burned[Chorus:]
Now I know that love ain’t meant to be a play thing
Now I know it’s not an ordinary everyday thing
Now I know that when it's right it's so amazing
When it’s wrong you gotta let it go
Now I know
Now I know[Hook:]
I don’t regret a single day
Joy and pain along the way
A broken heart’s the price we pay
As sad as it may seem
Baby can’t you see
It’s the way it’s gotta be[Chorus:]
Now I know that love ain’t meant to be a play thing
Now I know it’s not an ordinary everyday thing
Now I know that when it's right it's so amazing
When it’s wrong you gotta let it go
Now I know
Now I know
Yeah
Now I know
I know

[Intro]
Lalala lalala la la lala la Ohhh
You know... I never felt like this before
Lalala lalala la la lala la Ohhh
Feels like.. so real[Verse 1]
I'm obsessive when just one thought of you comes up
And I'm aggressive just one thought of close enough
You got me stressing, incessantly pressing the issue
'Cause every moment gone you know I miss you
I'm the question and you're of course the answer
Just hold me close boy 'cause I'm your tiny dancer
You make me shaken up, never mistaken
But I can't control myself, got me calling out for help[Chorus:]
S.O.S. please someone help me.
It's not healthy... for me to feel this way
Y.O.U. are making this hard,
I can't take it, see it don't feel right
S.O.S. please someone help me
It's not healthy... for me to feel this way
Y.O.U. are making this hard
You got me tossin' and turnin' and can't sleep at night[Bridge:]
This time please someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind it's got me losing it
I'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me
Love is testing me but still I'm losing it
This time please someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losing it
I'm lost, you got me looking for the rest of me,
Got the best of me, so now I'm losing it[Verse 2]
Just your presence and I second guess my sanity
Yes it's a lesson, it's unfair, you stole my vanity
My tummy's up in knots so when I see you I get so hot
My common sense is out the door, can't seem to find the lock
Take on me (uh huh) you know inside you feel it right[CD version:] Take me on I'm put desire up in your arms tonight[Video version:] Take me on, I could just die up in your arms tonight.
I'm out with you, you got me head over heels
Boy you keep me hanging on the way you make me feel[Chorus:]
S.O.S. please someone help me.
It's not healthy... for me to feel this way
Y.O.U. are making (Y.O.U.) this hard,
You got me tossin' and turnin' and can't sleep at night[Bridge:]
This time please someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losing it ('Cause you on my mind)
I'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me
Love is testing me but still I'm losing it
This time please someone come and rescue me (someone come and rescue me)
'Cause you on my mind got me losing it
I'm lost, you got me looking for the rest of me,
Got the best of me, so now I'm losing it
Boy, you know you got me feeling open
And boy, your loves enough with words unspoken
I said boy I'm telling you, you got me open
I don't know what to do it's true
I'm going crazy over you,
I'm begging[Chorus:]
S.O.S. please somebody help me.
It's not healthy... for me to feel this way
Y.O.U. are making this hard (are you making this hard for me, baby?),
You got me tossin' and turnin' and can't sleep at night[Bridge:]
This time please someone come and rescue me (someone rescue me)
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losing it
I'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me
Love is testing me but still I'm losing it
This time please someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind got me losing it ('cause any time)
I'm lost you, got me looking for the rest of me,
Got the best of me (best of me), I'm losing it[Outro]
Lala lala lala lala Ohhh
Ohh ohh lala lala lala lala
Oh oh


Kisses don't
No they don't
Never don't lie
You can run if you want but you cant hide
Telling you its the truth don't you ask why
Kisses don't
No they don't
Kisses don't lie[Verse 1:]
Emotions come and go
Who knows how the wind will blow?
There so little in this world to trust in
Seduce themselves with lies
Some don't realize
They call it love but its really only lusting[Refrain:]
So you see you and me
We're getting close to the danger zone
Show me how tell me now
Should I stay or should I go
Cause I'm caught between yes and no[Hook:]
Cause when you kiss me
I feel everything that I been missing
I try to slow down but my heart wont listen
And its tearing me all up inside
And when you touch me
I feel a rush but I'm afraid that it might crush me
Should I put my trust in something I don't trust in
I try to run but theres no place to hide
Cause baby kisses don't lie
Kisses don't
No they don't
Never don't lie
You can run if you want but you cant hide
Telling you its the truth don't you ask why
Kisses don't
No they don't
Kisses don't lie[Verse 2:]
You whisper in my ear
But are your words sincere
Cause pretty words can cut just like a knife
You see I'm nobody's fool
I play by my own rules
So please think twice before you step into my life[Refrain:]
So you see you and me
We're getting close to the danger zone
Show me how tell me now
Should I stay or should I go
Cause I'm caught between yes and no[Hook x2][Refrain][Hook]


Story of my life
Searching for the right
But it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul
'Cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company
He's more than a man
And this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in
Because I'm gone again
And to him I just can't be true
And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be...
A murderer
I feel it in the air
As I'm doing my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek
As he reluctantly
Asks if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long
Just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know
Where I'm about to go
And we know it very well
'Cause I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be...
A murderer
Our love, his trust
I might as well take a gun and put it to his head
Get it over with
I don't wanna do this
Anymore
Whoa, oh.
Anymore (anymore)
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
And every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
And I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be...
A murderer (a murderer)
No, no, no
Yeah, yeah, yeah


[Chorus:]
Ride when we ride we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
When we ride we ride
It's 'til the day that we die[Verse 1]
It's real late
'Bout a quarter to 1
I'm thinking about everything we've become
And I hate it
I thought we could make it
But I'm ready to dead this
Just wanna forget about it
I saw her pictures
And the letters she sent
You had me thinking
You were out we your friends
I'm so foolish
Play me like I'm stupid
'Cause I thought it was just you and I (oh)[Hook:]
Now I look back on the time
That we spent and
I see it in my mind
Playing over and over again
'Cause boy right now
You got me breaking down
And I just can't figure out why
But this is what you say[Chorus x2][Verse 2]
Visions in my mind
Of the day that we met
You showed me things
That I'll never forget
Took me swimming
In the ocean
You had my head up in the clouds
Made me feel like I'm floating (yeah)
You think I'm playing
When you know it's the truth
Nobody else can do it
Quite like I do
All my kisses
And my loving
But ain't nobody
Better than us[Hook][Chorus x2][Verse 3]
I guess it's over
Indefinitely
But you and I know
It's not that easy
To let go
Of everything (everything) that we planned
And start all over again
Just blame yourself cause you blew it
I won't forget how you do it
Sweet baby
This is where the game ends now
Somehow wanna believe you and me
We can figure it out[Chorus]
You finna make me say boy
I wish that you come hold me
When I'm lonely
When I need someone to talk to
You would phone me
Just like everything you told me
(when we ride we ride it's 'til the day that we die)
Boy you forgot about the promises
You made me
And now we'll let the memories
Just fade away
But I remember
What you used to say
(when we ride we ride it's 'til the day that we die)[Chorus x2]
We ride


[Verse 1:]
I'm not concerned with people 
Who prey on the wealth of their fellow man (oh yea)
Cause they only want to know you, enroll you
Only for the things ya had
I just think its so sad[Hook:]
Get dem haters out your circle 
Smile in your face but all they wanna do is bring ya down 
See them try to mess to hurt you
And work you
Anything to bring ya down[Verse 2:]
They keep evil thoughts in their hearts (what you dont know)
You can't let them knock your hustle
Not letting them know how much you struggle
They turn green with envy when your on top
And dem heart is full with strife
Their by gonna try to take your life[Hook:][Bridge:]
Ya know they talk about ya and they tell the lies
Dont be fooled u betta recognize
They not there for you
They dont care for you
Trust me cuz i know its true
Ya see they smile in your face and make ya think they down
Then they turn against you when your not around
Its just jealousy and dishonesty
So hold on to your sanity[Hook]


[Verse 1]
I never should of waited so long to say
What I've always known since the very first day
Thought that you would stay forever with me
But the time has come to leave[Chorus]
Before we turn out the lights and close our eyes
I'll tell you a secret I've held all my life
Its you that I live for, and for you I die
So I'll Lay here with you 'til the final goodbye[Verse 2]
Hold, draw me close, close to my lips
Listen intently as I tell you this
Outside the world wages its wars,
I'll rest in peace as long as you know[Chorus]
Before we turn out the lights and close our eyes
I'll tell you a secret I've held all my life
Its you that I live for, and for you I die
So I'll Lay here with you 'til the final goodbye[Bridge]
Promise you our love will carry on
Until you turn eternal, we belong[Chorus:]
Before we turn out the lights and close our eyes
I'll tell you a secret I've held all my life
It's you that I live for, and for you I die
So I'll lay here with you till the final goodbye
His respectful lips for the last time
And spell out the lyrics to love in the sky
Its you that I live for and for you I die
So I'll lay here with you till the final goodbye
Goodbye

Since I met you boy my whole worlds changed
I can't hide this or deny this[Chorus]
Boy you got me catching feelings
Got me thinking maybe you're the one
I didn't understand the reason

no other way[Bridge and fade]


[verse 1]
Whats up?
I know we haven't spoken for a while
But I was thinkin bout you
And it kinda made me smile
So many things to say
And I'll put em in a letter
Thought it might be easier
The words might come out better
How's your mother, how's your little brother?
Does he still look just like you?
So many things I wanna know the answers to
Wish I could press rewind
And rewrite every line
To the story of me and you[chorus]
Don't you know I've tried and I've tried
To get you out my mind
But it don't get no better
As each day goes by
And I'm lost and confused
I've got nothin to lose
Hope to hear from you soon
P.S. I'm still not over you
Still not over you[verse 2]
Excuse me, I really didn't mean to ramble on
But there's a lot of feelings that remain since you've been gone
I guess you thought that I would put it all behind me
But it seems there's always somethin right there to remind me
Like a silly joke, or somethin on the t.v.
Boy it aint easy
When I hear our song
I get that same old feeling
Wish I could press rewind
Turn back the hands of time
And I shouldn't be telling you[chorus]
Don't you know I've tried and I've tried
To get you out my mind
But it don't get no better
As each day goes by
And I'm lost and confused
I've got nothin to lose
Hope to hear from you soon
P.S. I'm still not over you
Still not over you
Did you know I kept all of your pictures
Don't have the strength to part with them yet
Oh no....
Tried to erase the way your kisses taste
But some things a girl can never forget[chorus]
Don't you know I've tried and I've tried
To get you out my mind
But it don't get no better
As each day goes by
And I'm lost and confused
I've got nothin to lose
Hope to hear from you soon
P.S. I'm still not over you
Still not over you


Some girls play the game
They all walk and talk
And they dress the same
Nothin' New To Say
Don't they realize
That it's so easy to see
Right though there disguise
Makes me wonder why
When the whole worlds turnin left
It's when I'm goin right
I need someone to let me be
Just who I am inside
`Cause a girl like me
Is just a lil' different from all the rest
And a girl likes me
Never gonna settle for Second Best
Could it be a boy like you
That would give me anything
If I asked him to
To take all my dreams
And Make them true
Show me all the reasons that you
Ought to be with a girl like me
Just like me
Possibility
Got me trippin'
Thinkin' of what could be
Between you and me
Still I need to know
Should I keep this feelin'
Or let it go
I can't wait no more
So now's the time
To speak your mind
And Show me what you feel
So tell me if you
Want to take a chance
On something real
`Cause a girl like me
Is just a lil' different from all the rest
And a girl likes me
Never gonna settle for Second Best
Could it be a boy like you
That would give me anything
If I asked him to
To take all my dreams
And Make them true
Show me all the reasons that you
Ought to be with a girl like me
Just like me
Mirror Mirror on the wall
Catch me now before I fall
I wish I may, I wish I might
Find the Answer here tonight
Mirror Mirror on the wall
Catch me now before I fall

Here we lay face to face once again
Silence cuts like a knife as we pretend.
And I'm wondering who will be the first to say what we both know
We're just holding on to "could have been"s and we should be letting go.[Chorus:]
It feels like you're a million miles away as you're lying here with me tonight.
I can't even find the words to say I can find a way to make it right.
And we both know that the story's ending,
We play the part but we're just pretending and I can't hide the tears
'cause even though you're here,
It feels like you're a million miles away.
Was it me, or was it you that broke away?
For what we were is like a season love is change
And every time I think about it, it tears me up inside.
Like the rivers of emotion but I got no more tears to cry.[Chorus:][Music Plays:][Bridge]
We can try to talk it over but we walked that road before,
While our song is playing its last note,
We both know for sure that it's time to close that door.[Chorus:]

As long as we’ve been together

Nobody knows you better

When your friends start to trip 
And you’re loosin your grip 
And you cant find your way back home 
When your world falls apart 
And you’re lost in the dark

When you just can deal, and you need something real 
Someone that’ll always come through 
Who ya gonna run to?

You and me we go back to jump rope and grade school 
Memories when you were tryin’ so hard to play cool

As long as we’ve been together 
You’ve always been the one 
Nobody knows you better 
When all is said and done 
When your friends start to trip 
And you’re loosin your grip 
And you cant find your way back home 
When your world falls apart 
And you’re lost in the dark 
And you know that your all alone 
When you just can deal, and you need something real 
Someone that’ll always come through 
Who ya gonna run to?

There ain’t nobody who can ever understand like I do (I do) 
So when you realise you need the one you said goodbye to (bye to)

You know I’m gonna be right there (right there) 
When your friends start to trip 
And your loosin your grip

And you know that your all alone 
When you just can deal, and you need something real 
Someone that’ll always come through

When there’s nobody else in the world you can put your trust in 
(Who ya gonna run to) 
And you find all the haters around you, they don’t mean nothing 
(Who ya gonna run to) 
Who ya gonna run to?


Looking back it's hard for me to see
Just how I could have been so blind
Like an actor on a movie screen
You played the part with every line
Well every story doesn't have a happy ending
Sometimes a flower doesn't grow
I hope you understand the message that I'm sending
But boy I think you need to know
(Coulda been the one)
That I would give it all to catch you when you fall boo
(Shoulda been the one)
Didn't know just what you had boy
Now it's just too bad boy
(After all is said and done)
You're a cheater and a liar
Went to play with fire
Boy I hope that you enjoyed your fun
Cuz you coulda been the one
There's nothing left to say
Coulda been the one
Coulda been
Shoulda been
My momma didn't raise no fool
She said play with fire you get burned
You laughed at me, I laugh at you
Now it seems the table's turned
I must admit I really thought you had potential
But I could not have been more wrong
I need somebody I can trust with his essentials
You had your chance but now I'm long gone
(Coulda been the one)
I would give it all to catch you when you fall boo
(Shoulda been the one)
Didn't know just what you had boy
Now it's just too bad boy
(After all is said and done)
You're a cheater and a liar
Went to play with fire
Boy I hope that you enjoyed your fun
Cuz you coulda been the one
You coulda been the one baby
(You coulda been the one)
Oh yeah
You played yourself boy
And there is no denying it
It's just the way the story goes
You made your bed boy
Better go and lay in it
But know that you'll be laying there alone
You coulda been the one
(Coulda been the one)
I would give it all to catch you when you fall boo
(Shoulda been the one)
Didn't know just what you had boy
Now it's just too bad boy
(After all is said and done)
You're a cheater and a liar
Went to play with fire
Boy I hope that you enjoyed your fun
Cuz you coulda been the one

Uh huh, uh huh (Yea Rihanna)
Uh huh, uh huh (Good girl gone bad)
Uh huh, uh huh (Take three... Action)
Uh huh, uh huh
No clouds in my stones
Let it rain, I hydroplane in the bank
Coming down with the Dow Jones
When the clouds come we gone, we Rocafella
We fly higher than weather
In G5's are better, You know me,
In anticipation, for precipitation. Stack chips for the rainy day
Jay, Rain Man is back with little Ms. Sunshine
Rihanna where you at?[Rihanna]
You have my heart
And we'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines
But you'll still be my star
Baby 'cause in the dark
You can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you I'll always share
Because[Chorus]
When the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'd be here forever
Said I'll always be a friend
Took an oath I'ma stick it out 'til the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella
(Ella ella eh eh eh)
Under my umbrella
(Ella ella eh eh eh)
Under my umbrella
(Ella ella eh eh eh)
Under my umbrella
(Ella ella eh eh eh eh eh eh)
These fancy things, will never come in between
You're part of my entity, here for infinity
When the war has took its part
When the world has dealt its cards
If the hand is hard, together we'll mend your heart
Because[Chorus]
When the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'd be here forever
Said I'll always be a friend
Took an oath I'ma stick it out 'til the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella
(Ella ella eh eh eh)
Under my umbrella
(Ella ella eh eh eh)
Under my umbrella
(Ella ella eh eh eh)
Under my umbrella
(Ella ella eh eh eh eh eh eh)
You can run into my arms
It's OK, don't be alarmed
Come here to me
There's no distance in between our love
So go on and let the rain pour
I'll be all you need and more
Because[Chorus]
When the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be a friend
Took an oath I'ma stick it out 'til the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella
(Ella ella eh eh eh)
Under my umbrella
(Ella ella eh eh eh)
Under my umbrella
(Ella ella eh eh eh)
Under my umbrella
(Ella ella eh eh eh eh eh eh)

We break, break, we break, break, we break, break we're breaking down [2x]
It's getting later baby, and I'm getting curious
nobody's looking at us, I feel delirious
'cause the beat penetrates my body
shaking inside my bones
and you pushing all my buttons, taking me outta my zone[Bridge:]
The way that you stare, starts a fire in me
Come up to my room you sexy little thing
And let's play a game, I won't be a tease
I'll show you the room, my sexy little thing[Chorus:]
I wish you would push up on me
I wish you would push up on me
I wish you would light me up and say you want me
push up on me [2x]
I know many guys just like ya, extremely confident
Got so much flavor with you, like you're the perfect man
You wanna make me chase ya like it's a compliment
But let's get right down to it
I could be the girl that'll break you down[Bridge][Chorus]
We break, break, we break, break, we break, break we're breaking down [2x]
I wanna see how you move
Show me, show me how you do it
You really got me on it, I must confess
Baby there ain't nothing to it
Baby, who you think you're fooling?
You wanna come get me outta my dress[Bridge][Chorus]


Please don't stop the music
Please don't stop the music
Please don't stop the music
Please don't stop the music
It's getting late
I'm making my way over to my favourite place
I gotta get my body moving
Shake the stress away
I wasn't looking for nobody when you looked my way
Possible candidate, yeah
Who knew
That you'd be up in here looking like you do
You're making staying over here, impossible
Baby, I must say your aura is incredible
If you don't have to go, don't
Do you know what you started?
I just came here to party
But now we're rocking on the dance floor, actin' naughty
Your hands around my waist
Just let the music play
We're hand in hand, chest to chest and now we're face to face[CHORUS]
I wanna take you away
Let's escape into the music, DJ let it play
I just can't refuse it
Like the way you do this
Keep on rockin' to it
Please don't stop the, please don't stop the music
I wanna take you away
Let's escape into the music, DJ let it play
I just can't refuse it
Like the way you do this
Keep on rockin' to it
Please don't stop the, please don't stop the
Please don't stop the music
Baby are you ready cause it's getting close
Don't you feel the passion ready to explode?
What goes on between us no-one has to know
This is a private show
Do you know what you started?
I just came here to party
But now we're rocking on the dance floor, actin' naughty
Your hands around my waist
Just let the music play
We're hand in hand, chest to chest and now we're face to face[CHORUS][x4]
Please don't stop the music[CHORUS x2]
Please don't stop the music
Please don't stop the music

[Verse 1]
I've been looking for a driver who's qualified
So if you think that you're the one step into my ride
I'm a fine-tuned supersonic speed machine
With a sunroof top and a gangster lean[Bridge]
So if you feel me let me know, know, know
Come on now what you waiting for, for, for
My engine's ready to explode, explode, explode
So start me up and watch me go, go, go, go[Chorus] 
Got you where you wanna go if you know what i mean
Got a ride that smoother than a limosine
Can you handle the curves? Can you run all the lights?
If you can baby boy then we can go all night
Cos I'm 0 to 60 in three point five
Baby you got the keys-
Now shut up and drive
(drive, drive, drive)
Shut up and drive
(drive, drive, drive)[Verse 2]

Got all the drive but a whole lot of boom in the back
You look like you can handle whats under my hood
You keep saying that you will boy I wish you would[Bridge]
So if you feel me let me know, know, know
Come on now what you waiting for, for, for
My engine's ready to explode, explode, explode
So start me up and watch me go, go, go, go[Chorus] 
Got you where you wanna go if you know what i mean
Got a ride that smoother than a limosine

[Rihanna:]
That's how much I love you
That's how much I need you
And I can't stand you
Must everything you do make me wanna smile
Can I not like you for awhile? (No....)[Ne-Yo:]
But you won't let me
You upset me girl
And then you kiss my lips
All of a sudden I forget (that I was upset)
Can't remember what you did[Rihanna:]
But I hate it...
You know exactly what to do
So that I can't stay mad at you
For too long that's wrong[Ne-Yo:]
But I hate it...
You know exactly how to touch
So that I don't want to fuss.. and fight no more
Said I despise that I adore you[Rihanna:]
And I hate how much I love you boy (yeah...)
I can't stand how much I need you (I need you...)
And I hate how much I love you boy (oh whoa..)
But I just can't let you go
And I hate that I love you so (oh..)[Ne-Yo:]
You completely know the power that you have
The only one makes me laugh[Rihanna:]
Said it's not fair
How you take advantage of the fact
That I... love you beyond the reason why
And it just ain't right[Ne-Yo:]
And I hate how much I love you girl
I can't stand how much I need you (yeah..)
And I hate how much I love you girl
But I just can't let you go
But I hate that I love you so[Both:]
One of these days maybe your magic won't affect me
And your kiss won't make me weak
But no one in this world knows me the way you know me
So you'll probably always have a spell on me...[Ne-Yo:]
Yeah... Oh...[Rihanna:]
That's how much I love you (as much as I need you)
That's how much I need you (oh..)
That's how much I love you (oh..)
As much as I need you[Rihanna:]
And I hate that I love you so
And I hate how much I love you boy
I can't stand how much I need you (can't stand how much I need you)
And I hate how much I love you boy
But I just can't let you go (but I just can't let you go no..)
And I hate that I love you so
And I hate that I love you so.. so...

[Verse 1]
Sell me candy like it’s summer when it’s melting in my hands
I know you’re around like the ice cream man
I can hear you calling, whisper something in my ear
You're sweet like sugar, tell me what I wanna hear
I’m weak by your touch and when it’s melting on my lips
I run through my body when you lick my fingertips
You’re selling me a fantasy that I want to explore
It sounds so good spoil me rotten to the core[Bridge:]
Talk to me
Take care of my dreams
All I need
Is you beside me
It’s destiny
Just let it be
If words can speak
Then baby sell it to me[Chorus:]
Sell me candy, sell me love, sell me heaven, sell me doves
What’s the charge? What’s the cost?
(I’m the daddy)… you the boss.[Verse 2]
You could be a professional, boy you make a sale
I try to resist but every time I fail
The one temptation that I gotta endure
The running through my body now you’re knocking at my door
A thin little kiss and your call is really sweet
But the shawty that you’re rocking is nothing like me
You’re selling me a fantasy that I want to explore
It sounds so good spoil me rotten to the core (you know…)[Bridge][Chorus][Verse 3]
I wanna play… more than you know
So don’t you leave… and don’t you go
I want it all… until time falls
His arms… I want to roam
I want to love… give him my trust
I want to live… for both of us
I want to breathe you… lay on your shoulder
I want to warm you… when nights get colder
I want love… love… love
I want love… love… love[Bridge][Chorus]


[Chorus]
I got a house, but I need new furniture,
Why spend mine when I could spend yours
The truth is I will love you the same
But why complain you buying gucci babe[Verse 1]
You might see me in the spot
Ya boy think I'm hot
So I came up in here to get what you got
I'm hot like the block
Ugh Huh you like that

Ugh Huh yea right there
They love the young girl
They wanna give it to me
Wish I was in a flick
And I ain't talking movies
If ya young,if ya hot girl
Shake what ya got girl
I keep 'em singing...[Pre-Hook]
Lemme hit that (Huh?)

(Rihanna Better slow down, for I make you crash boy)
Got what you want
Baby got what you need,
But we can't proceed 
Unless you got that for me[Chorus][Verse 2]
I'm a put you on the spot
keep the sheet in knots
I bought me a benz, 
You buy me the yacht
A girl need a lot, 
The girl need some stocks
Bonds is what I got, bonds is what I got (ya get it?)
They love the young girl
They wanna give it to me
Wish I was in a flick,
and I ain't talking movies
If ya young, if ya hot girl
Shake what ya got girl
I keep em singing...[Pre-Hook][Chorus][Bridge]
Oh...Oh...Oh...
Boy I know you want my love
Oh...Oh...Oh...
Nothing is free in this world
Oh...Oh...Oh...
Unless my love is your love
Oh...Oh...Oh...
I'm not a gold digger[Pre-Hook][Chorus-End]


[Verse 1:]
Baby, baby
When we first met
I never felt something so strong
You were like my lover
And my best friend
All wrapped into one
With a ribbon on it
And all of a sudden
you went and left
I didn't know how to follow
It's like a shock
That spun me around
And now my heart's dead
I feel so empty and hollow[Pre Chorus:]
And I'll never give myself to another
The way I gave it to you
Don't even recognize
The ways you hurt me
Do you?
It's gonna take a miracle to bring me back
And you're the one to blame[Chorus:]
And now I feel like, oh
You're the reason
Why I'm thinking
I don't wanna smoke on
These cigarettes no more
I guess that's what I get
For wishful thinking
Should've never let you enter my door
Next time you wanna go on and leave
I should just let you go on and do it
Cause now I'm using like I bleed
It's like I checked into rehab
Baby you're my disease
It's like I checked into rehab
Baby you're my disease
I gotta check into rehab
'Cause baby you're my disease
I gotta check into rehab
'Cause baby you're my disease[Verse 2:]
Damn,
Ain't it crazy
When you're loveswept
You'll do anything
For the one you love
'Cause anytime
That you needed me
I'd be there
It's like
You were my favorite drug
The only problem is
That you was using me
In a different way
That I was using you
But now that I know
That it's not meant to be
You gotta go
I gotta wean myself off of you[Pre Chorus:][Chorus:][Ad libs][Chorus:]


Take off my shirt.
Loosen the buttons and undo my skirt,
Stare at myself in the mirror
Take me apart piece by piece,
Sorrow decrease
Pressure release, I put in work
Did more than called upon, More than deserved
When it was over, Did I wind up hurt (Yes)?
But it taught me before a decision ask this question first[Chorus:]
Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances are given, Question Existing
Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances are given, Question Existing
Take off my coat,
show them that under here,
I'm just like you do the mistakes,
I may make me a fool or a human with flaws,
admit that I'm loss
Round of applause,
Take the abuse
Sometimes it feels like they want me to lose
It's entertainment is that an excuse? (No)
But the question that lingers whether "win or lose"[Chorus]
Dear Diary,
It's Robyn
Entertaining is something I do for a living
It's not who I am, I'd like to think that I'm pretty normal,
I laugh, I get mad, I hurt, I think
Guys suck sometimes,
But when you're in the spotlight,
Everything seems good,
Sometimes I feel like i have it worst cause I have to always keep my guard up,
I don't know who to trust, I don't know who wants to date me for who I am,
Or who wants to be my friend for who I really am,[Chorus]


We stay moving around, solo
Ask us where you at, we don't know
And don't care (don't care)
All we know is we was at home cause you left us there
You got your boys and got gone
And left us all alone
Now she in the club with a freaky dress on
Cats don't want her to keep that dress on
Trying to get enough drinks in her system
Take it to the tele and make her a victim
Patron on brain, ball play you in the face
They shake the spot, she's just another case[Chorus]
Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we gone (gone)
Best believe we've gone forever
Don't be the reason
Don't be the reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad
We die forever
He's staying with a flock of them, oh, yeah
Got a girl at home but he don't care
Won't care (won't care)
All he'll do is keep me at home, won't let me go nowhere
He thinks because I'm at home I won't be getting it on
And now I'm finding numbers in the jacket pockets
Tricks calling the house, non stop its
Getting out of control
Finally I can't take no more
He finds a letter on the stairs, saying this is the end
I packed my bag and left with your best friend[Chorus]
We stay moving around, solo
Ask us where you at, we don't know
And don't care (don't care)
All we know is we was at home cause you left us there
You got your boys and got gone
And left us all alone[Chorus]
We're gone forever
We're gone forever


I'm not the type to get my heart broken
I'm not the type to get upset and cry
'cause I never leave my heart open
Never hurts me to say goodbye
Relationships don't get deep to me
Never got the whole in love thing
And someone can say they love me truly
But at the time it didn't mean a thing[Chorus:]
My mind is gone, I'm spinning round
And deep inside, my tears I'll drown
I'm losing grip, what's happening
I stray from love, this is how I feel
This time was different
Felt like, I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I'm, in this condition
And I've, got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what you'll never see me cry
Did it happen when we first kissed?
'cause it's hurting me to let it go
Maybe 'cause we spent so much time
And I know that it's no more
I should've never let you hold me baby
Maybe why I'm sad to see us apart
I didn't give to you on purpose
Can't figure out how you stole my heart[Chorus]
How did I get here with you, I'll never know?
I never meant to let it get so, personal
And after all I tried to do, to stay away from loving you
I'm broken hearted, I can't let you know
And I won't let it show
You won't see me cry[x2]
This time was different
Felt like, I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I'm, in this condition
And I've, got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what you'll never see me cry
All my life...


[Verse 1:]
The steps on the stairs
Aren't really there
Feel like there's someone watching me
Shadows on the wall
Whispers down the hall
When I look theres nothing to see
You say that you let her go
Turn the page and closed the door
Can't get inside your head
'cause when I try, she's there instead[Chorus:]
I can't compete with a memory
How can I fight with someone that I can't see?
Theres two of us but it feels like three
I wish her ghost would just let us be
Boy your everything I ever wanted
But I got to let you go 'cause this love is...
Haunted
Haunted[Verse 2:]
You say that shes gone
That you've moved on
so why do I feel her eyes on me
Invisible chains keep us in pain
Won't you please tell her set you free?
Sometimes when you look past me
Your eyes see someone I can't see
So I've given up this war
'cause I can't fight it anymore[Chorus:]
I can't compete with a memory
How can I fight with someone that I can't see?
Theres two of us but it feels like three
I wish her ghost would just let us be
Boy your everything I ever wanted
But I got to let you go 'cause this love is...
Haunted
Haunted[Bridge:]
Wish I could cast a spell to make her spirit leave
The walls close and then its so damn hard to breath[Spoken Whisper:] There is nothing I could do about it...[Chorus:]
I can't compete with a memory
How can I fight with someone that I can't see?
Theres two of us but it feels like three
I wish her ghost would just let us be
Boy your everything I ever wanted
But I got to let you go 'cause this love is...
Haunted
Haunted...
Haunted
Haunted
I don't want to fight anymore
Someone is walking out that door...
Haunted
Haunted...

What's wrong with me?
Why do I feel like this?
I'm going crazy now
No more gas in the rig

Nothing heard, nothing said
Can't even speak about it
Out my life, out my head
Don't wanna think about it
Feels like I'm going insane

To come and grab you
It can creep up inside you
And consume you
A disease of the mind
It can control you
It's too close for comfort
Throw on your brake lights
We're in the city of wonder
Ain't gonna play nice
Watch out, you might just go under
Better think twice
Your train of thought will be altered
So if you must falter be wise
Your mind is in disturbia

Oh, how about a round of applause, yeah
A standing ovation
Oh, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You look so dumb right now
Standing outside my house
Trying to apologize
You're so ugly when you cry
Please, just cut it out[Chorus:]
Don't tell me you're sorry 'cause you're not
Baby when I know you're only sorry you got caught
But you put on quite a show
Really had me going
But now it's time to go
Curtain's finally closing
That was quite a show
Very entertaining
But it's over now (but it's over now)
Go on and take a bow
Grab your clothes and get gone (get gone)
You better hurry up
Before the sprinklers come on (come on)
Talking' bout'
Girl, I love you, you're the one
This just looks like a re-run
Please, what else is on (on)[Chorus][Bridge]
Oh, and the award for
The best lie goes to you (goes to you)
For making me believe (that you)
That you could be faithful to me
Let's hear your speech, oh
How about a round of applause
A standing ovation
But you put on quite a show
Really had me going
Now it's time to go
Curtain's finally closing
That was quite a show
Very entertaining
But it's over now (but it's over now)
Go on and take a bow
But it's over now


[Maroon 5] 
Now as the summer fades, I let you slip away 
You say I'm not your type, But I can make you sway. 
It makes you burn to learn, you're not the only one 
I'd let you be if you put down your blazing gun. [Rihanna] 
Now you've gone somewhere else, Far away 
I don't know if I will find you (find you, find you). 
But you feel my breath, on your neck 
Can't believe I'm right behind you (right behind you). [Both] 
'Cause you keep me coming back for more (Coming back for more)
And I feel a little better than I did before [Rihanna]
And if I never see your face again, I don't mind [Both]
'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight [Rihanna] 
Sometimes you move so well 
It's hard not to give in. [Maroon 5] 
I'm lost, I can't tell 
Where you end and I begin. [Rihanna] 
It makes you burn to learn 
I'm with another man. [Maroon 5] 
I wonder if he's half 
The lover that I am. 
Now you've gone somewhere else, Far away 
I don't know if I will find you (find you, find you). 
But you feel my breath, on your neck 
Can't believe I'm right behind you (right behind you). [Both] 
'Cause you keep me coming back for more (Coming back for more) 
And I feel a little better than I did before [Rihanna]
If I never see your face again, I don't mind [Both]
'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight [Maroon 5] 
Baby, baby 
Please believe me 
Find it in your heart to reach me 
Promise not to leave me behind 
(Promise not to leave me behind) [Rihanna] 
Take me down, but take it easy 
Make me think but don't deceive me 
Torture me by taking your time 
(Torture me, torture me)  
'Cause you keep me coming back for more 
And I feel a little better than I did before [Both] 
If I never see your face again, I don't mind 
'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight (torture me, torture me)[Both] 
'Cause you keep me coming back for more (Coming back for more)
And I feel a little better than I did before (Did before)
And if I never see your face again, I don't mind 
'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight

Ride this beat, beat, beat like a pony
Meet me at the top (top, top)
Gettin' lonely

Run through your town

Brilliant, resilient
Fan mail from 27 millions
And I want it all
It's gonna take more than that
Hope that ain't all you got
Baby all you got

So hard, so hard, so hard, so hard
Go hard or go home
Back to your residence
Soon the red dogs will give the block back to the presidents
I used to run my own block like Obama did
You ain't gotta believe me, go ask my momma then
You couldn't even come in my room
it smelled like a kilo
Looked like me and two of my boys playing casino
Trying to sell they peeping my bag they can't afford it
Tell 'em to give me back my swag
They tryin' to clone me
See my Louis tux, Louis flag, Louis frames, Louis belt
What that make me
Louis mane?
I'm in an all white party wearin' all black
With my new black watch call it the heart attack
Cardiac arrest, cardiac a wrist
Yeah, they say they're hard
They ain't hard as this
Hard!
The one word describes me
If I wasn't doin' this
You know where I be, too hard
Where dem girls talkin' trash
Where dem girls talkin' trash
Where they at, where they at, where they at?
Where dem bloggers girls at
Where dem bloggers girls at
Where they at, where they at, where they at?
Where your lighters at
